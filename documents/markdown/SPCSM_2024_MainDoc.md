***Note:*** See the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer CAnswer Forum for questions about

**AJCC TNM staging, Grade, the Site-Specific Data Items, and data items not required by SEER. SEER**

required data items are listed in the NAACCR Required Status Table.

## Collection and Storage of Dates

Dates may be collected and stored in any format, including the traditional format, (month, day, year [MMDDYYYY]), or the recommended date format, (year, month, day [YYYYMMDD]); however, the recommended format must be used for transmission (see Transmission Instructions for Dates below). See the [2023 and 2024 NAACCR Implementation Guidelines for further information regarding the updated data](https://www.naaccr.org/implementation-guidelines/) exchange standard.

## Transmission Instructions for Dates

Dates must be transmitted in the year, month, day format (YYYYMMDD). The transmission requirements are intended to follow a left-to right- transmission which ensure the minimum allowable information is listed first, allowing only valid portions of the date are transmitted; missing and unknown portions of dates are not transmitted. If there are no known date components, the date data item will be completely blank. For example

- YYYYMMDD - when complete date is known and valid
- YYYYMM - when year and month are known and valid, and day is unknown
- YYYY - when year is known/estimated, and month and day are unknown
- Blank - when no known date applies; no spaces should be used

***Note: Date of Diagnosis cannot be entirely blank. See the specific coding instructions for each date data***

item.

Most SEER registries collect the month, day, and year. When the full date (YYYYMMDD) is transmitted for Date of Diagnosis and/or Date of Last Follow-Up or of Death, the seventh and eighth digits will be held confidentially and only used for survival calculations when received by NCI SEER.

## SEER Site-Specific Factors 1 - 6

Six data items have been set aside as place holders. Five of these data items are not in use and must be left blank. SEER Site-Specific Factor 1 is reserved for capturing information on human papilloma virus (HPV) status. These SEER site-specific factors are not part of the Collaborative Stage Data Collection System.

| NAACCR Item # | Item Name | Codes/Data Collected |
|---|---|---|
| 3700 | SEER Site-Specific Factor 1 | HPV |
| 3702 | SEER Site-Specific Factor 2 | Blank |
| 3704 | SEER Site-Specific Factor 3 | Blank |
| 3706 | SEER Site-Specific Factor 4 | Blank |
| 3708 | SEER Site-Specific Factor 5 | Blank |

# Introduction

## SEER Program

Two programs, the End Results Group and the Third National Cancer Survey, were predecessors of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. SEER publishes the 2024 SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual to provide instructions and descriptions that are detailed enough to promote consistent abstracting and coding.

## SEER Coding and Staging Manual Contents

The 2024 SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual includes data item descriptions, codes, and coding instructions for cases diagnosed January 1, 2024, and forward as reported by SEER registries. For all cases diagnosed on or after January 1, 2024, the instructions and codes in this manual take precedence over all previous instructions and codes. Updates to this manual identified after publication will be found in SINQ under the category of 'Updates to current manual' until a subsequent revision of this manual is issued. The 2024 SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual explains the format and the definitions of the data [items required by SEER. Documentation and codes for historical data items can be found in earlier versions](http://datadictionary.naaccr.org/?c=8) of the SEER Program Code Manual. Earlier versions are available on the SEER website. This coding manual does not prevent SEER contract registries or other registries that follow SEER rules from collecting additional data items useful for those regions. Data items that are not required for 2024 diagnoses but were collected in years prior to 2024 must be transmitted to SEER as blanks for cases diagnosed in 2024 and subsequent years. Descriptions of historic data items, allowable codes, and coding rules can be found in historic coding manuals on the SEER website.

# Reportability

## Dates of Diagnosis/Residency

SEER registries are required to collect data on persons who are diagnosed with cancer and who, at the time of diagnosis, are residents of the geographic area covered by the SEER registry. Cases diagnosed on or after January 1, 1973 are reportable to SEER. Registries that joined the SEER Program after 1973 have different reporting start dates specified in their contracts. All cases meeting these criteria are reportable to SEER, including non-analytic cases.

## Reportable Diagnosis List

Definition of Reportable: Meets the criteria for inclusion in a registry. Reportable cases are cases that the registry is required to collect and report. Reporting requirements for SEER registries are established by NCI SEER. A "Reportable List" includes all diagnoses to be reported by the registry to NCI SEER. Refer to Appendix E.1 for reportable examples and to the ICD-O-3.2 Updates for new/changed behaviors and terms.

#### 1. Malignant Histologies (In Situ and Invasive)

a. Report all histologies with a behavior code of /2 or /3 in the ICD-O- Third Edition,

## Diagnosis Prior to Birth

SEER reportability requirements apply to diagnoses made in utero. Diagnoses made in utero are reportable

**only when the pregnancy results in a live birth. In the absence of documentation of stillbirth, abortion or**

fetal death, assume there was a live birth and report the case.

## Disease Regression

When a reportable diagnosis is confirmed prior to birth and disease is not evident at birth due to regression, accession the case based on the pre-birth diagnosis.

## Reportable Examples

Refer to Appendix E.1 for reportable examples.

## Non-Reportable Examples

Refer to Appendix E.2 for non-reportable examples.

**September 2023 Reportability 16**

## Instructions for Reporting Solid Tumors

Reportability instructions in this manual apply to solid tumors. For hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms, see the Reportability Instructions in the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual and [*Database.*](http://www.seer.cancer.gov/tools/heme/)

## Documentation of Reportable Diagnoses

A reportable diagnosis made by a recognized medical practitioner may appear on a variety of medical documentation including, but not limited to

- Pathology report
- Cytology report
- Imaging report
- Discharge diagnosis
- History and physical
- Other parts of medical record
- Death certificate
- Autopsy report

**Cases diagnosed clinically are reportable. In the absence of a histologic or cytologic confirmation of a**

reportable neoplasm, accession a case based on the clinical diagnosis (when a recognized medical practitioner says the patient has a cancer, carcinoma, malignant neoplasm, or reportable neoplasm). A clinical diagnosis may be recorded in the discharge diagnosis on the face sheet or other parts of the medical record. ***Note:*** A pathology report normally takes precedence over a clinical diagnosis. If the patient has a negative biopsy, the case would not be reported.

#### Exceptions

1. Patient receives treatment for cancer. Accession the case. ***Note:*** Standard treatments for cancer may be given for non-malignant conditions. Follow back with the physician to clarify if needed.
2. It has been six months or longer since the negative biopsy, and the physician continues to call

this a reportable disease. Accession the case.

## Intracranial or CNS Neoplasms

An intracranial or a CNS neoplasm identified only by diagnostic imaging is reportable.

**"Neoplasm" and "tumor" are reportable terms for intracranial and CNS because they are listed in**

ICD-O-3.2 with behavior codes of /0 and /1.

**"Mass" and "lesion" are not reportable terms for intracranial and CNS because they are not listed in**

ICD-O-3.2 with behavior codes of /0 or /1.

**September 2023 Reportability 17**

-----

## Ambiguous Terminology

Ambiguous terminology may originate in any source document, such as a pathology report, radiology report, or clinical report. The terms listed below are reportable when they are used with a term such as cancer, carcinoma, sarcoma, etc. Ambiguous terms not listed below are not reportable.

### Cytology

Do not accession a case based ONLY on suspicious cytology. Follow back on cytology diagnoses using ambiguous terminology is strongly recommended. Accession the case when a reportable diagnosis is confirmed later. The date of diagnosis is the date of the suspicious cytology. ***Note 1:*** "Suspicious cytology" means any cytology report diagnosis that uses an ambiguous term, including ambiguous terms that are listed as reportable in this manual.

***Note 2: This is a change to previous instructions. The date of a suspicious cytology may be used as the date***

of diagnosis when a definitive diagnosis follows the suspicious cytology. See Date of Diagnosis for more information. Cytology refers to the microscopic examination of cells in body fluids obtained from aspirations, washings, scrapings, and smears; usually a function of the pathology department.

**Important: Accession cases with cytology diagnoses that are positive for malignant cells. Urine cytology positive for malignancy is reportable. Code the primary site to C689 in the absence of any**

### Ambiguous Terms for Reportability

Apparent(ly) Appears Comparable with Compatible with Consistent with Favor(s) Malignant appearing Most likely Presumed Probable Suspect(ed) Suspicious (for) Typical (of) Report cases that use the words on the list or an equivalent word such as "favored" rather than "favor(s)." Do not substitute synonyms such as "supposed" for presumed or "equal" for comparable. Do not substitute "likely" for "most likely." Use all available information first and seek clarification from clinicians whenever possible. Equivalent to "Diagnostic for" malignancy or reportable diagnosis. These phrases are reportable when no

**other information is available or there is no information to the contrary.**

- Considered to be [malignancy or reportable diagnosis]
- Characteristic of [malignancy or reportable diagnosis]

**September 2023 Reportability 18**

-----

- Appears to be a [malignancy or reportable diagnosis]
- Most compatible with [malignancy or reportable diagnosis]
- Most certainly [malignancy or reportable diagnosis]
- In keeping with [malignancy or reportable diagnosis] Equivalent to "Not diagnostic for" malignancy or reportable diagnosis. These phrases are NOT reportable when no other information is available.
- Highly suspicious for, but not diagnostic of [malignancy or reportable diagnosis]
- Most compatible with a [non-reportable diagnosis] such as a [reportable diagnosis]
- High probability for [malignancy or reportable diagnosis] Equivalent to "Differential diagnoses"
- Differential considerations There may be ambiguous terms preceded by a modifier, such as "mildly" suspicious. In general, ignore modifiers or other adjectives and accept the reportable ambiguous term. If there is no information to the contrary, report a case described as "malignant until proven otherwise." The patient should have further work up to prove or disprove the findings. When additional information becomes available, update as necessary. Use text fields to describe the details.

### Ambiguous Terminology Lists: References of Last Resort

This section clarifies the use of Ambiguous Terminology as listed in STORE 2018 for case reportability and staging in Commission on Cancer (CoC)-accredited programs. When abstracting, registrars are to use the "Ambiguous Terms at Diagnosis" list with respect to case reportability, however, these lists need to be used

**correctly.**

The first and foremost resource for the registrar for questionable cases is the physician who diagnosed and/or staged the tumor. The ideal way to approach abstracting situations when the medical record is not clear is to follow up with the physician. If the physician is not available, the medical record, and any other pertinent reports (e.g., pathology, etc.) should be read closely for the required information. The purpose of the Ambiguous Terminology lists is so that in the case where wording in the patient record is ambiguous with respect to reportability or tumor spread and no further information is available from any resource, registrars will make consistent decisions. When there is a clear statement of malignancy or tumor spread (i.e., the registrar can determine malignancy or tumor spread from the resources available), they should not refer to the Ambiguous Terminology lists. Registrars should only rely on these lists when the situation is not clear and the case cannot be discussed with the appropriate physician/pathologist. The CoC recognizes that not every registrar has access to the physician who diagnosed and/or staged the tumor, and as a result, the Ambiguous Terminology lists continue to be used in CoC-accredited programs and maintained by CoC as "references of last resort."

## How to Use Ambiguous Terminology for Case Ascertainment

#### 1. In Situ and Invasive (Behavior codes /2 and /3)

a. If any of the reportable ambiguous terms precede a word that is synonymous with a

reportable in situ or invasive tumor (e.g., cancer, carcinoma, malignant neoplasm, etc.), accession the case. ***Example:*** The pathology report says: Prostate biopsy with markedly abnormal cells that are typical of adenocarcinoma. Accession the case. ***Negative Example:*** The final diagnosis on the outpatient report reads: Rule out pancreatic cancer. Do not accession the case.

**September 2023 Reportability 19**

-----

b. Discrepancies

i. Accession the case based on the reportable ambiguous term when there are

reportable and non-reportable ambiguous terms in the medical record

1. Do not accession a case when the original source document used a non-

**reportable ambiguous term and subsequent documents refer to history of**

cancer ***Example:*** Report from the dermatologist is "possible melanoma." Patient admitted later for unrelated procedure and physician listed history of melanoma. No further information available, no evidence of treatment for melanoma. Give priority to the information from the dermatologist and do not report this case. "Possible" is not a reportable ambiguous term. The later information is less reliable in this case. ii. Accept the reportable term and accession the case when there is a single report in

which both reportable and non-reportable terms are used ***Example:*** Abdominal CT reveals a 1 cm liver lesion. "The lesion is consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma" appears in the discussion section of the report. The final diagnosis is "1 cm liver lesion, possibly hepatocellular carcinoma." Accession the case. "Consistent with" is a reportable ambiguous term. Accept "consistent with" over the non-reportable term "possibly." c. Do not accession a case based ONLY on suspicious cytology

***Note:*** "Suspicious cytology" means any cytology report diagnosis that uses an ambiguous term, including ambiguous terms that are listed as reportable on the preceding page. Follow back on cytology diagnoses using ambiguous terminology is strongly recommended. Cytology refers to the microscopic examination of cells in body fluids obtained from aspirations, washings, scrapings, and smears; usually a function of the pathology department.

**Important: Accession cases with cytology diagnoses that are positive for malignant**

cells. d. Use the reportable ambiguous terms when screening diagnoses on pathology reports,

operative reports, scans, mammograms, and other diagnostic testing with the exception of tumor markers i. Do not accession a case when resection, excision, biopsy, cytology, or physician's

statement proves the ambiguous diagnosis is not reportable ***Example 1:*** Mammogram shows calcifications suspicious for intraductal carcinoma. The biopsy of the area surrounding the calcifications is negative for malignancy. Do not accession the case. ***Example 2:*** CT report states "mass in the right kidney, highly suspicious for renal cell carcinoma." CT-guided needle biopsy with final diagnosis "Neoplasm suggestive of oncocytoma. A malignant neoplasm cannot be excluded." Discharged back to the nursing home and no other information is available. Do not accession the case. The suspicious CT finding was biopsied and not proven to be malignant. "Suggestive of" is not a reportable ambiguous term. ***Example 3:*** Stereotactic biopsy of the left breast is "focally suspicious for DCIS" and is followed by a negative needle localization excisional biopsy. Do not accession the case. The needle localization excisional biopsy was performed to

**September 2023 Reportability 20**

further evaluate the suspicious stereotactic biopsy finding. The suspicious diagnosis was proven to be false. ***Example 4:*** Esophageal biopsy with diagnosis of "focal areas suspicious for adenocarcinoma in situ." Diagnosis on partial esophagectomy specimen "with foci of high grade dysplasia; no invasive carcinoma identified." Do not accession the case. The esophagectomy proved that the suspicious biopsy result was false.

2. **Benign and borderline primary intracranial and CNS tumors**

| a. | Use the "Ambiguous terms that are reportable" list above to identify benign and borderline primary intracranial and CNS tumors that are reportable |
|---|---|
| b. | "Neoplasm" and "tumor" are reportable terms for intracranial and CNS because they are listed in ICD-O-3.2 with behavior codes of /0 and /1 |
| c. | Accession the case when any of the reportable ambiguous terms precede either the word "tumor" or the word "neoplasm" Example: The mass on the CT scan is consistent with pituitary tumor. Accession the case. |
| d. | "Mass" and "lesion" are not reportable terms for intracranial and CNS because they are not listed in ICD-O-3.2 with behavior codes of /0 or /1 |
| e. | Discrepancies |

i. Accession the case based on the reportable ambiguous term when there are

reportable and non-reportable ambiguous terms in the medical record

1. Do not accession a case when subsequent documents refer to history of

tumor and the original source document used a non-reportable ambiguous term ii. Accept the reportable term and accession the case when there is a single report and

one section of a report uses a reportable term such as "apparently" and another section of the same report uses a term that is not on the reportable list

***Exception: Do not accession a case based ONLY on ambiguous cytology (the reportable***

term is preceded by an ambiguous term such as apparently, appears, compatible with, etc.). f. Use the reportable ambiguous terms when screening diagnoses on pathology reports,

scans, ultrasounds, and other diagnostic testing other than tumor markers i. Do not accession the case when resection, excision, biopsy, cytology or

physician's statement proves the ambiguous diagnosis is not reportable

See the Reportability Instructions in the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual and [*Database.*](http://seer.cancer.gov/tools/heme/index.html)

## Casefinding Lists

Current and previous casefinding lists are available on the SEER website. Use the casefinding lists to screen prospective cases and identify cancer cases for inclusion in the registry. It is important to include all casefinding sources when searching for reportable cases.

**September 2023 Reportability 21**

-----

Sources include

- Inpatient/Outpatient Admission/Discharge Documents
- Pathology/Cytology Pathology Reports
- Surgery Logs/Schedules
- Radiology
- Nuclear Medicine
- Radiation Therapy Logs
- Chemotherapy Outpatient Logs
- Emergency Room Records
- Autopsy Reports
- Pain Clinic Logs A casefinding list is not the same as a reportable list. Casefinding lists are intended for searching a variety of cases so as not to miss any reportable cases. Definition of Casefinding (case ascertainment): Process of identifying all reportable cases through review of source documents and case listings. Casefinding covers a range of cases that need to be assessed to determine whether or not they are reportable.

# Changing Information on the Abstract

The information originally collected on the abstract should be changed or modified under the following

circumstances

1. To correct coding or abstracting errors (for example, errors found during quality control

activities)

2. **When clarifications or rule changes retroactively affect data item code**

***Example:*** SEER adds codes to a data item and asks the registries to review a set of cases and update using the new codes.

3. **When better information is available later**

***Example 1:*** Consults from specialty labs, pathology report addenda or comments or other information have been added to the chart. Reports done during the diagnostic workup and placed on the chart after the registrar abstracted the information may contain valuable information. Whenever these later reports give better information about the histology, grade of tumor, primary site, etc., change the codes to reflect the better information. ***Example 2:*** The primary site was recorded as unknown at the time of diagnosis. At a later date, the physician determines that the cancer is primary to the testis. Change the primary site from unknown to testis. ***Example 3:*** The original diagnosis was in situ. Metastases are diagnosed at a later date. Change the behavior code for the original diagnosis from in situ to invasive when no new primary has

**been diagnosed in the interim.**

***Example 4:*** Patient seen in Hospital A. The pathologic diagnosis was negative for malignancy. Patient goes to Hospital B and the slides from Hospital A are re-read. The diagnosis at Hospital B is reportable. Hospital B sends their slide report back to Hospital A. Hospital A reports the case based on the info from Hospital B. Enter supporting documentation in a text field.

4. **When the date of diagnosis is confirmed in retrospect to be earlier than the original date**

**abstracted**

***Example:*** Patient has surgery for a benign argentaffin carcinoid (8240/1) of the sigmoid colon in May 2023. In January 2024, the patient is admitted with widespread metastasis consistent with malignant argentaffin carcinoid. The registrar accessions the malignant argentaffin carcinoid as a 2024 diagnosis. Two months later, the pathologist reviews the slides from the May 2023 surgery and concludes that the carcinoid diagnosed in 2023 was malignant. Change the date of diagnosis to May 2023 and histology to 8241 and the behavior code to malignant (/3).

## Type of Reporting Source

#### Item Length: 1 NAACCR Item #: 500 NAACCR Name: Type of Reporting Source XML NAACCR ID: typeOfReportingSource

*Type of Reporting Source identifies the source documents that provided the most complete information when* abstracting the case. This is not necessarily the original document that identified the case; rather, it is the source that provided the most complete information.

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Hospital inpatient; Managed health plans with comprehensive, unified medical records (new code definition effective with diagnosis on or after 01/01/2006) |

2 Radiation Treatment Centers or Medical Oncology Centers (hospital affiliated or independent)

(effective with diagnosis on or after 01/01/2006) 3 Laboratory Only (hospital affiliated or independent) 4 Physician's Office/Private Medical Practitioner (LMD) 5 Nursing/Convalescent Home/Hospice 6 Autopsy Only 7 Death Certificate Only 8 Other hospital outpatient units/surgery centers (effective with diagnosis on or after 01/01/2006)

### Definitions

#### Comprehensive, unified medical record

- A hospital or managed health care system that maintains a single record for each patient. That

record includes all encounters in affiliated locations.

#### Stand-alone medical record

- An independent facility; a facility that is not a part of a hospital or managed care system
- An independent medical record containing only information from encounters with that specific

facility or practice

#### Managed health plan

- Any practice and/or facility where all of the diagnostic and treatment information is maintained in

one unit record

- The abstractor is able to use the unit record when abstracting the case

***Examples of such facilities: HMOs or other health plan such as Kaiser, Veterans***

Administration, or military facilities

#### Physician office

- A physician office performs examinations and tests. Physician offices may perform limited

surgical procedures

***Note:*** The category "physician's office" also includes facilities that are called surgery centers when surgical procedures under general anesthesia cannot be performed in these facilities.

**September 2023 Section II: Information Source 33**

-----

#### Surgery center

- Surgery centers are equipped and staffed to perform surgical procedures under general anesthesia
- The patient usually does not stay overnight

***Note:*** If the facility cannot perform surgical procedures under general anesthesia, code as physician's office.

#### Unit record

- All records for the patient from all departments, clinics, offices, etc. in a single file with the same

medical record number

| Code Label | Source Documents | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Hospital inpatient | 1 |

2 Radiation Treatment Facilities with a stand-alone medical record 2

| 3 | Laboratory Only | Laboratory with a stand-alone medical record | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | Physician's | Physician's office that is NOT an HMO or large multi- | 4 |
| 5 | Nursing/Convalescent | Nursing or convalescent home or a hospice | 6 |
| 6 | Autopsy Only | Autopsy | 7 |
| 7 | Death Certificate Only | Death certificate | 8 |

8 Other hospital outpatient Other hospital outpatient units/surgery centers 3

**September 2023 Section II: Information Source 34**

-----

***Example:*** Surgery for primary cancer performed at hospital as outpatient (no overnight stay). Assign code 1 if the hospital is part of a managed health plan with comprehensive, unified medical records - meaning that a single record is maintained for each patient and that record includes all encounters in affiliated locations. Otherwise, assign code 8.

### Priority Order for Assigning Type of Reporting Source

Code the source that provided the best information used to abstract the case.

***Example:*** The only patient record available for a physician office biopsy is the pathology report identified from a freestanding laboratory. Assign code 3 [Laboratory Only (hospital-affiliated or independent)]. Reporting source should reflect the lab where this case was identified. The MD office added nothing to the case, not even a confirmation of malignancy. When multiple source documents are used to abstract a case, use the following priority order to assign a code for Type of Reporting Source: Codes: 1, 2, 8, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7. ***Note:*** Beginning with cases diagnosed 01/01/2006, the definitions for this data item have been expanded. Codes 2 and 8 were added to identify outpatient sources that were previously grouped under code 1. Laboratory reports now have priority over nursing home reports. The source facilities included in the previous code 1 (hospital inpatient and outpatient) are split between codes 1, 2, and 8. SEER recommends that you do not make changes to this data item for historic cases in the central cancer registry database; i.e., cases diagnosed prior to January 1, 2006. Conversion of the old codes would be problematic and would require extensive and time-consuming review of original source documents.

## Place of Residence

### Place of Residence at Diagnosis

SEER registries collect information on place of residence at diagnosis. Information relating to address is not transmitted to SEER. The SEER rules for determining residency at diagnosis are either identical or comparable to rules used by the U.S. Census Bureau, to ensure comparability of definitions of cases (numerator) and the population at risk (denominator).

### Coding Priorities/Sources

1. Code the street address of usual residence as stated by the patient. Definition: U.S. Census

Bureau Instructions: "The place where he or she lives and sleeps most of the time or the place the person says is his or her usual home." The residency rules of departments of vital statistics may differ from those of the U.S. Census Bureau/SEER.

2. **A post office box is not a reliable source to identify the residency at diagnosis. Post office box**

addresses do not provide accurate geographical information for analyzing cancer incidence. Use the post office box address only if no street address information is available after follow-back.

3. Use residency information from a death certificate only when the residency from other sources

is coded as unknown. Review each case carefully and apply the U.S. Census Bureau/SEER rules for determining residence. a. For example, the death certificate may give the person's previous home address rather

than the nursing home address as the place of residence. If the person was a resident of a nursing home at diagnosis, use the nursing home address as the place of residence.

4. Do not use legal status or citizenship to code residence

### Persons with More than One Residence

1. Code the residence where the patient spends the majority of time (usual residence)
2. If the usual residence is not known or the information is not available, code the residence the

patient specifies at the time of diagnosis

***Examples: The above rules should be followed for "snowbirds" who live in the south for the***

winter months, "sunbirds" who live in the north during the summer months, and people with vacation residences that they occupy for a portion of the year.

### Persons with No Usual Residence

Homeless people and transients are examples of persons with no usual residence. Code the patient's residence at the time of diagnosis such as the shelter or the hospital where diagnosis was confirmed.

**September 2023 Section III: Demographic Information 43**

-----

### Temporary Residents of SEER Area

Code the place of usual residence rather than the temporary address for

#### Migrant workers Educators temporarily assigned to a university in the SEER area Military personnel on temporary duty assignments (TDY)

Persons temporarily residing with family during cancer treatment

#### Boarding school students below college level (code the parent's known residence)

Code the residence where the student is living for

College students while attending college

**Exchange students temporarily living in the U.S.**

Code the address of the institution for Persons in Institutions.

***Note: Code the physical address of the institution. Do not code the post office box.***

*U.S. Census Bureau definition: "Persons under formally authorized, supervised care or custody" are* residents of the institution."

Persons who are incarcerated Persons who are physically handicapped, mentally challenged, or mentally ill who are residents of homes, schools, hospitals or wards Residents of nursing, convalescent, and rest homes Long-term residents of other hospitals such as Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals

### Persons in the Armed Forces and on Maritime Ships (including Merchant Marine) Armed Forces

For military personnel and their family members, code the address of the military installation or surrounding community as stated by the patient.

### Personnel Assigned to Navy, Coast Guard, and Maritime Ships

The U.S. Census Bureau has detailed rules for determining residency for personnel assigned to these ships. The rules refer to the ship's deployment, port of departure, destination, and its homeport. Refer to U.S. Census Bureau Publications for detailed rules.

## Census Tract 2010

#### Item Length: 6 NAACCR Item #: 135 NAACCR Name: Census Tract 2010 XML NAACCR ID: censusTract2010

*Census Tract 2010 is coded by the central registry. It is computer generated using patient address* information. Census Tract 2010 records the census tract of a patient's residence at the time of diagnosis. The codes are the same codes used by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Year 2010 census. This item is coded for cases diagnosed January 1, 2006, and forward. This data item allows a central registry to add year 2010 Census tracts to cases diagnosed in previous years without losing the codes in the data items Census Tract *1970/80/90 and Census Tract 2000 which are only collected historically.* A census tract is a small statistical subdivision of a county that, in general, has between 2,500 and 8,000 residents. Local committees and the U.S. Census Bureau establish census tract boundaries and try to keep the same boundaries from census to census to maintain historical comparability, though this is not always possible. When populations increase or decrease, old tracts may be subdivided, disappear, or have their boundaries changed. Because the census tracts do change, it is important to know which census tract definition is used to code them.

### Codes

Census tract codes 000100-999998

### Special Codes

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 000000 | Area not census-tracted |
| 999999 | Area census-tracted, but census tract is not available |
| Blank | Census Tract 2010 not coded |

### Coding Instructions

1. Code the Census tract of the patient's residence at the time of diagnosis
2. Census tract codes should be assigned based on a computer match (geocoding software)
3. Census tracts are identified by four-digit numbers ranging from 0001 to 9989 and a two-digit

suffix

4. Assign code 999999 when an area does have an assigned census tract but the census tract is not

available

5. Right justify the first four digits and zero fill to the left. Add the suffix as the fifth and sixth

digits if it exists; otherwise, use 00 so all six positions are coded. ***Example 1:*** Code census tract 516 and suffix 21 to 051621. ***Example 2:*** Census tract 409 and suffix does not exist should be coded 040900.

## Race 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

#### Item Length: 2 NAACCR Item #: 160, 161, 162, 163, 164 NAACCR Name: Race 1, Race 2, Race 3, Race 4, Race 5

#### XML NAACCR ID: race1, race2, race3, race4, race5

Race and ethnicity are defined by specific physical, hereditary and cultural traditions or origins, not necessarily by birthplace, place of residence, or citizenship. 'Origin' is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or in some cases, the country of birth of the person or the person's parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States. The five race data items (Race 1 - Race 5) make it possible to code multiple races for one person, consistent with the 2000 Census. All resources in the facility, including the medical record, face sheet, physician and nursing notes, photographs, and any other sources, must be used to determine race. If a facility does not print race in the medical record but does maintain it in electronic form, the electronic data must also be reviewed.

**Recommendation: Document how the race code(s) was (were) determined in a text field.**

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 01 | White |
| 02 | Black or African American |
| 03 | American Indian or Alaska Native |
| 04 | Chinese |
| 05 | Japanese |
| 06 | Filipino |
| 07 | Native Hawaiian |
| 08 | Korean |
| 10 | Vietnamese |
| 11 | Laotian |
| 12 | Hmong |
| 13 | Cambodian |
| 14 | Thai |
| 15 | Asian Indian, NOS or Pakistani, NOS |
| 16 | Asian Indian (Effective with 01/01/2010 dx) |
| 17 | Pakistani (Effective with 01/01/2010 dx) |
| 20 | Micronesian, NOS |
| 21 | Chamorro |
| 22 | Guamanian, NOS |
| 25 | Polynesian, NOS |
| 26 | Tahitian |
| 27 | Samoan |
| 28 | Tongan |
| 30 | Melanesian, NOS |
| 31 | Fiji Islander |
| 32 | Papua New Guinean |
| 88 | No additional races (Race 2 - Race 5) |
| 96 | Other Asian, including Asian, NOS |
| 97 | Pacific Islander, NOS |
| 98 | Some other race |
| 99 | Unknown by patient |

**September 2023 Section III: Demographic Information 76**

-----

### Priorities for Coding Multiple Races

1. Code 07 takes priority over all other codes

***Example:*** Patient is described as Japanese and Hawaiian. Code Race 1 as 07 (Native Hawaiian), Race 2 as 05 (Japanese).

2. Codes 02-32, 96-98 take priority over code **01**
3. Code only the specific race when both a specific race code and a non-specific race code apply

| a. | Codes 04-17 take priority over code 96 |
|---|---|
| b. | Codes 16-17 take priority over code 15 |
| c. | Codes 20-32 take priority over code 97 |
| d. | Codes 02-32 and 96-97 take priority over code 98 |
| e. | Code 98 takes priority over code 99 |

### Coding Instructions

1. Do not use patient name as the basis for coding race

a. See Coding Instruction 15, Exception, for the only situation in which name is taken into

account when coding race

2. Code race using the highest priority source available according to the list below (a is the highest

and c is the lowest) when race is reported differently by two or more sources. Use self-reported information as first priority. a. Self-reported race information takes precedence over genetic testing and over information

obtained through linkages. Generally, race information is used from linkages when race data are missing or unknown, or to enhance data. Self-reported information is the highest priority for coding race because the race information for the U.S. population comes from census data and that information is self-reported. For national cancer statistics, in order for the numerator (cancer cases) and the denominator (population) to be comparable, use self-reported race information whenever it is available.

#### Sources in Priority Order

| a. | The patient's self-declared identification |
|---|---|
| b. | Documentation in the medical record |
| c. | Death certificate |

3. Assign the same race code(s) for all tumors for one patient
4. Code the race(s) of the patient in data items Race 1, Race 2, Race 3, Race 4, and Race 5

a. Code 88 for the remaining race data items (Race 2 - Race 5) when at least one race, but

fewer than five races, are reported

5. Use the associated text field to document

a. Why a particular race code was chosen when there are discrepancies in race information

***Example: The patient is identified as Black in nursing notes and White in a dictated***

physical exam. Use a text field to document why one race was coded rather than the other. b. That no race information is available

**September 2023 Section III: Demographic Information 77**

-----

6. Code as 01 (White) when

| a. | The race is described as White or Caucasian regardless of place of birth |
|---|---|
| b. | There is a statement that the patient is Hispanic or Latino(a) and no further information is available |

i. A person of Spanish origin may be any race; however, for coding race when there

is no further information other than "Hispanic" or "Latino(a)," assign race as White as a last resort instead of coding unknown. ***Example:*** Sabrina Fitzsimmons is a Latina. No further information is available. Code race as 01 (White). ***Note 1:*** Do not code 98 (Other) in this situation. ***Note 2:*** Persons of Spanish or Hispanic origin may be of any race, although persons of Mexican, Central American, South American, Puerto Rican, or Cuban origin are usually White.

7. Code race as 02 (Black or African American) when the stated race is African-American, Black,

or Negro

8. Assign code 03 for any person stated to be

| a. | Native Alaskan (western hemisphere) OR |
|---|---|
| b. | American Indian, whether from North, Central, South, or Latin America |
| Note: | Do not change race coding based on results from IHS linkage |

9. Assign a specific code when a specific Asian race is stated. Do not use code 96 when a specific

race is known. ***Example:*** Patient is described as Asian in a consult note and as second generation Korean- American in the history. Code Race 1 as 08 (Korean) and Race 2 through Race 5 as 88. ***Note:*** Do not code 96 (Other Asian including Asian, NOS) in a subsequent race data item when a specific Asian race has been coded.

10. Code the race based on birthplace information when the race is recorded as Oriental,

Mongolian, or Asian and the place of birth is recorded as China, Japan, the Philippines, or another Asian nation ***Example 1:*** Race is recorded as Asian and the place of birth is recorded as Japan. Code race as 05 (Japanese) because it is more specific than 96. ***Example 2:*** The person describes himself as an Asian-American born in Laos. Code race as 11 (Laotian) because it is more specific than 96.

11. Use the appropriate non-specific code 96 (Other Asian including Asian, NOS), 97 (Pacific

Islander, NOS), or 98 (Some other race) when there is no race code for a specific race

***Note: Document the specified race in a text field.***

12. Do not use code 96, 97, or 98 for "multi-racial." See Coding Examples below.
13. All race data items must be coded 99 (Unknown by patient) when Race 1 is coded 99

(Unknown by patient) ***Note: Assign code 99 in Race 2 -Race*** *5* **only when Race 1 is coded 99.**

14. Assign code 99 for death certificate only (DCO) cases when race is unknown

**September 2023 Section III: Demographic Information 78**

-----

15. Refer to Appendix D "Race and Nationality Descriptions" when race is unknown or not stated

in the medical record and birth place is recorded a. In some cases, race may be inferred from the nationality. Use Appendix D to identify

nationalities from which race codes may be inferred. ***Example 1:*** Record states: "this native of Portugal..." Code race as 01 (White) per the Appendix. ***Example 2:*** Record states: "this patient was Nigerian..." Code race as 02 (Black or African American) per the Appendix. ***Exception: Code Race 1 through Race 5 as*** 99 (Unknown by patient) when patient's name is incongruous with the race inferred on the basis of nationality. Do not code the inferred race when the patient's name is incongruent with the race inferred on the basis of nationality.

***Example 1:*** Patient's name is Siddhartha Rao and birthplace is listed as England. Code *Race 1 through Race 5 as 99 (Unknown).* ***Example 2:*** Patient's name is Ping Chen and birthplace is Ethiopia. Code Race 1 through *Race 5 as 99 (Unknown).*

16. When the patient face-sheet indicates "Race Other," look for other descriptions of the patient's

race. When no further race information is available, code race as 99 (Unknown by patient) and document that patient face-sheet indicates "Race Other," and no further race information is available.

17. Patient photographs may be used with caution to determine race in the absence of any other

information a. Use caution when interpreting a patient photograph to assist in determining race. Review

the patient record for a statement to verify race. The use of photographs alone to determine race may lead to misclassification of race.

18. Code the race data items in the order stated when no other priority applies
19. The race of parents, when known, may be used with caution to determine patient's race in the

absence of other more specific information (see coding examples 5 and 7)

### Coding Examples

***Example 1:*** Patient is stated to be Japanese. Code as 05 (Japanese). ***Example 2:*** Patient is stated to be German-Irish. Code as 01 (White). ***Example 3:*** Patient is described as Arabian. Code as 01 (White). ***Example 4:*** Patient described as a black female. Code as 02 (Black or African American). ***Example 5:*** Patient states she has a Polynesian mother and Tahitian father. Code Race 1 as 25 (Polynesian), *Race 2 as 26 (Tahitian) and Race 3 through Race 5 as* ***Example 6:*** Patient describes herself as multi-racial (nothing more specific) and nursing notes say "African- American." Code Race 1 as 02 (Black or African American) and Race 2 through Race 5 as 88. ***Example 7:*** The patient is described as Asian-American with Korean parents. Code race as 08 (Korean) because it is more specific than 96 (Asian) [-American].

**September 2023 Section III: Demographic Information 79**

-----

***Example 8:*** *Race 1 through Race 5 in the cancer record are coded as 99 (Unknown by patient). The death* certificate states race as black. Change cancer record for Race 1 to 02 (Black or African American) and Race *2 through Race 5 to 88.* ***Example 9:*** *Race 1* is coded in the cancer record as 96 (Asian). Death certificate gives birthplace as China. Change Race 1 in the cancer record to 04 (Chinese) and code Race 2 through Race 5 as 88.

***Example 10: Patient is stated to be Chinese and black. Code Race 1 as 04 (Chinese), code Race 2 as 02***

(Black or African American). Code in the order stated when no other priority applies.

***Example 11: Patient described as Middle Eastern. Code as 01 (White). Example 12: Patient described as Greek. Code as 01 (White). Example 13: Race 1 is coded by one facility as 02 (Black or African American) and Race 1 is coded by a***

different facility as 03 (American Indian or Alaska Native); no further documentation is provided. When consolidating records at the central cancer registry, code Race 1 as 98 (Some other race). If the patient is identified as Native American via the IHS linkage, follow usual procedures. ***Example 14: Patient is from Guyana.*** Patient's race is coded differently in multiple source records using codes such as 02 (Black or African American) for Race or 98 (Some other race) or 15 (Asian Indian, NOS or Pakistani, NOS) for example; no further documentation is provided. When consolidating records at the central cancer registry, code Race 1 as 98 (Some other race).

Example 15: Electronic medical record indicates patient is "Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander." Look for other descriptions of the patient's race. When no other information is available, assign 97, Pacific

### Islander, NOS.

***Example 16: Patient is "Belgian." Medical record indicates "non-Hispanic, other race." Patient appears***

white on scanned driver's license photo. Assign race code 01 for white. "Belgium" is classified as "European" in appendix D and European is included under the descriptions for white. Driver's license photo supports this.

### History

| a. | For cases with all diagnoses prior to January 1, 2000, Race 2 through Race 5 must be blank |
|---|---|
| b. | For cases that have multiple tumors with at least one primary diagnosed on or after January 1, 2000, race codes in Race 1, Race 2, Race 3, Race 4, and Race 5 must be identical on all records |

3. Codes 08-13 became effective with diagnoses on or after January 1, 1988
4. Code 09 was retired effective with diagnoses on or after January 1, 2010
5. Code 14 became effective with diagnoses on or after January 1, 1994
6. Codes 15, 16, and 17 became effective with diagnoses on or after January 1, 2010

## IHS Link

#### Item Length: 1 NAACCR Item #: 192 NAACCR Name: IHS Link XML NAACCR ID: ihsLink

*Indian Health Service (IHS) Link reports the result of linkage between the registry database and the Indian* Health Service patient registration database. This linkage identifies American Indians who were misclassified as non-Indian in the registry. The computer linkage program will automatically assign the code for this data item. SEER requires the IHS Link for cases diagnosed January 1, 1988, and forward. IHS Link may be submitted for cases diagnosed in earlier years. The data item will be blank unless an attempt was made to link the case with the records from the Indian Health Service.

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 0 | Record sent for linkage, no IHS match |

**surname) and there is no evidence that he/she is not Hispanic.**

8 Dominican Republic (effective with diagnosis on or after 01/01/2005) 9 Unknown whether Spanish/Hispanic or not

### Coding Instructions

1. Coding Spanish Surname or Origin is not dependent on race. A person of Spanish descent may

be white, black, or any other race.

2. Use all information to determine the Spanish/Hispanic origin including

a. The ethnicity stated in the medical record

i. Self-reported information takes priority over other sources of information

| b. | Hispanic origin stated on the death certificate |
|---|---|
| c. | Birthplace |

#### Item Length: 1 NAACCR Item #: 191 NAACCR Name: NHIA Derived Hisp Origin XML NAACCR ID: nhiaDerivedHispOrigin

The NAACCR Hispanic Identification Algorithm (NHIA) is a computerized algorithm that uses a combination of variables to directly or indirectly classify cases as Hispanic for analytic purposes.

***Note: Surname lists are just one component of the indirect assignment of ethnicity or race by NHIA. A***

number of filters based on race, ethnicity, birthplace, or county attribute may preclude a patient from ever being indirectly assigned based on surname. Also, if a patient is coded as non-Hispanic, the registry may elect NOT to run the case through NHIA. A female patient's last name could, however, be used to classify the case as Hispanic for the NHIA variable after making it through the filters and exclusions. Persons are also included as Hispanic/Latino(a) when they are female cases with heavily Hispanic maiden names; female cases with missing maiden names and heavily Hispanic last names; female cases with generally Hispanic, moderately Hispanic, occasionally Hispanic, or indeterminate maiden names and heavily Hispanic last names.

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 0 | Non-Hispanic |
| 1 | Mexican, by birthplace or other specific identifier |
| 2 | Puerto Rican, by birthplace or other specific identifier |
| 3 | Cuban, by birthplace or other specific identifier |
| 4 | South or Central American (except Brazil), by birthplace or other specific identifier |
| 5 | Other specified Spanish/Hispanic origin (includes European; excludes Dominican Republic), by birthplace or other specific identifier |

| 6 | Spanish, NOS; Hispanic, NOS; Latino, NOS |
|---|---|
| 7 | NHIA surname match only |
| 8 | Dominican Republic |

# Section IV Description of this Neoplasm

## Pathology Reports

For the purposes of coding primary site, histologic type, and behavior, SEER recommends that information from consult pathology reports be preferred over the original pathology report. This is because consults are usually requested from a more experienced or specialized pathologist/lab and are generally thought to be more accurate.

**September 2023 Section IV: Description of this Neoplasm 92**

-----

## Date of Diagnosis

#### Item Length: 8 NAACCR Item #: 390 NAACCR Name: Date of Diagnosis XML NAACCR ID: dateOfDiagnosis

The date of diagnosis is the month, day, and year the reportable neoplasm was first identified, clinically or microscopically, by a recognized medical practitioner. Date of diagnosis must be transmitted in the YYYYMMDD format. Date of diagnosis may be recorded in the transmission format, or recorded in the traditional format (MMDDYYYY) and converted electronically to the transmission format. Regardless of the format, at least Year of diagnosis must be known or estimated

**for cases transmitted to SEER. Year of diagnosis cannot be blank or unknown for cases transmitted to SEER.**

### Transmitting Dates

Transmit date data items in the year, month, day format (YYYYMMDD). Transmit only known or estimated

**year of diagnosis; blanks will not be accepted for year. Leave the month, day and/or year1 blank when they**

cannot be estimated or are unknown.

### Common Formats

| YYYYMMDD | Complete date is known |
|---|---|
| YYYYMM | Year and month are known/estimated; day is unknown |
| YYYY | Year is known/estimated; month and day cannot be estimated or are unknown |
| Blank | Year,1 month, and day cannot be estimated or are unknown |

### Transmit Instructions

1. Transmit date data items in the year, month, day format (YYYYMMDD)
2. Transmit only known or estimated year of diagnosis, blanks will not be accepted
3. Leave the month and/or day blank when they cannot be estimated or are unknown
4. Most SEER registries collect the month, day, and year of diagnosis. When the full date

(YYYYMMDD) is transmitted, the seventh and eighth digits (day) will be held confidentially and only used for survival calculations when received by NCI SEER..

### Instructions

Cases with an unknown year of diagnosis cannot be transmitted to NCI SEER. It is very important to do everything possible to determine the year of diagnosis. Case transmitted to NCI SEER

1. Follow-back must be done to obtain the date of diagnosis. If no information can be found,

follow instruction 2.

1 Cases NOT transmitted to SEER only

**September 2023 Section IV: Description of this Neoplasm 93**

-----

2. Date of diagnosis must be estimated. See the coding instructions below for estimating date of

diagnosis. a. For reports dated December or January of a given year, code the month of the report or

the month of admission (instruction 9 .a.viii.). Coding the month of the report or the month of admission results in a better estimate of the date of diagnosis than coding month as 99 and having the computer assign July as the month of diagnosis, for example. b. When the diagnosis date is stated to be spring, summer, fall, or winter, follow coding

instructions 9.a.i., ii., iii., and iv. Case NOT transmitted to NCI SEER

1. Code the date of diagnosis when known, even if the case is not transmitted to SEER for other

reasons

2. Code as unknown when there is no information available

### Codes for Year

Code the four-digit year of diagnosis

### Codes for Month

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 01 | January |
| 02 | February |
| 03 | March |

| 12 | December |

### Codes for Day

01 02 03 .. .. 31

**September 2023 Section IV: Description of this Neoplasm 94**

-----

### Coding Instructions

1. Code the month, day and year the tumor was first diagnosed, clinically or microscopically, by a

recognized medical practitioner a. When the first diagnosis includes reportable ambiguous terminology, record the date of

that diagnosis ***Example:*** Area of microcalcifications in breast suspicious for malignancy on 02/13/2024. Biopsy positive for ductal carcinoma on 02/28/2024. The date of diagnosis is 02/13/2024.

2. When the only information available is a positive pathology or cytology report, code the date

the procedure was done as the date of diagnosis. Do not code the date the specimen was received, read as positive by the pathologist, or the date the report was dictated or transcribed. ***Example:*** Biopsy was performed on 05/06/2024. The specimen from the biopsy was received and read by the pathologist as positive for cancer on 05/09/2024. The date of diagnosis is 05/06/2024.

3. The first diagnosis of cancer may be clinical (i.e., based on clinical findings or physician's

documentation) ***Note:*** Do not change the date of diagnosis when a clinical diagnosis is subsequently confirmed by positive histology or cytology. ***Example 1:*** On May 15, 2024, physician states that patient has lung cancer based on clinical findings. The patient has a positive biopsy of the lung in June 3, 2024. The date of diagnosis remains May 15, 2024. ***Example 2:*** Radiologist reports Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) Category 5 on imaging. Later biopsy confirms hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Record date of diagnosis as date of LI-RADS imaging. ***Note:*** Appendix E in the 2024 SEER Program Coding and Staging Manual lists which PI-RADS, BI-RADS, and LI-RADS are reportable versus non-reportable. If reportable, use the date of the imaging procedure as the date of diagnosis when this is the earliest date and there is no information to dispute the imaging findings.

4. Positive tumor markers alone are not diagnostic of cancer. Use the date of clinical, histologic,

or positive cytologic confirmation as the date of diagnosis. ***Example 1:*** The patient has an elevated PSA and the physical examination is negative. The physician documents only that the patient is referred for a needle biopsy of the prostate. The biopsy is positive for adenocarcinoma. The date of diagnosis is the date of the biopsy (do not code the date of the PSA or the date the procedure was dictated or transcribed). ***Example 2:*** The patient has an elevated PSA and the physical examination is negative. The physician documents that he/she suspects that the patient has prostatic cancer and is referring the patient for a needle biopsy. The needle biopsy is positive, confirming the physician's suspicion of cancer. The date of diagnosis is the date the physician documented that he/she

**suspects that the patient has prostatic cancer.**

***Note:*** Positive tumor markers alone are never used for case ascertainment.

5. Use the date of suspicious cytology when the diagnosis is proven by subsequent biopsy,

excision, or other means ***Example:*** Cytology suspicious for malignancy 01/12/2024. Diagnosis of carcinoma per biopsy on 02/06/2024. Record 01/12/2024 as the date of diagnosis. ***Note 1:*** "Suspicious" cytology means that the diagnosis is preceded by an ambiguous term such as apparently, appears, compatible with, etc.

**September 2023 Section IV: Description of this Neoplasm 95**

-----

***Note 2:*** Do not use ambiguous cytology alone for case ascertainment.

6. Code the earlier date as the date of diagnosis when

| a. | A recognized medical practitioner says that, in retrospect, the patient had cancer at an earlier date or |
|---|---|
| b. | The original slides are reviewed and the pathologist documents that cancer was present. Code the date of the original procedure as the diagnosis date. |
| Example: | The patient had an excision of a benign fibrous histiocytoma in January 2024. Six |
| months | later, a wide re-excision was positive for malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The physician |
| documents | in the chart that the previous tumor must have been malignant. Code the diagnosis |
| date as | January 2024. |
| Note: | Do not back-date the diagnosis when |

- The information on the previous tumor is unclear AND/OR
- There is no review of previous slides AND/OR
- There is no physician's statement that, in retrospect, the previous tumor was malignant ***Example:*** The patient had a total hysterectomy and a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) in June 2024 with pathology diagnosis of papillary cystadenoma of the ovaries. In December 2024, the patient is diagnosed with widespread metastatic papillary cystadenocarcinoma. The slides from June 2024 are not reviewed and there is no physician statement saying the previous tumor was malignant. The date of diagnosis is December 2024.
7. Code the date of death as the date of diagnosis for autopsy only cases
8. Death certificate only (DCO) Cases

| a. | Use information on the death certificate to estimate the date of diagnosis |
|---|---|
| b. | Record the date of death as the date of diagnosis when there is not enough information available to estimate the date of diagnosis; for example, the time from onset to the date of death is described as 'years' |

c. If no information is available, record the date of death as the date of diagnosis

9. **Estimate the date of diagnosis if an exact date is not available. Use all information available to**

calculate the month and year of diagnosis. a. Estimating the month

i. Code "spring" to April ii. Code "summer" or "middle of the year" to July iii. Code "fall" or "autumn" as October iv. For "winter" try to determine whether the physician means the first of the year or

the end of the year and code January or December as appropriate. If no determination can be made, use whatever information is available to calculate the month of diagnosis. v. Code "early in year" to January vi. Code "late in year" to December vii. Use whatever information is available to calculate the month of diagnosis

***Example 1:*** Admitted October 2024. History states that the patient was diagnosed 7 months ago. Subtract 7 from the month of admission and code date of diagnosis to March 2024.

**September 2023 Section IV: Description of this Neoplasm 96**

-----

***Example 2:*** Outpatient bone scan done January 2024 that states history of prostate cancer. The physician says the patient was diagnosed in 2024. Assume bone scan was part of initial work-up and code date of diagnosis to January 2024. viii. Code the month of admission when there is no basis for estimation ix. Leave month blank (or convert 99 to blank) if there is no basis for approximation b. Estimating the year

i. Code "a couple of years" to two years earlier ii. Code "a few years" to three years earlier iii. Use whatever information is available to calculate the year of diagnosis iv. Code the year of admission when there is no basis for estimation

10. If no information about the date of diagnosis is available

a. Case transmitted to NCI SEER

i. Use the date of admission as the date of diagnosis ii. In the absence of an admission date, code the date of first treatment as the date of

diagnosis b. Case NOT transmitted to NCI SEER

i. Code month and year as unknown

Nursing Home and Hospice Residents (Not hospitalized for their cancer; no information other **than nursing home or hospice records and/or death certificate)**

1. Use the best approximation for the date of diagnosis when the only information available is

that the patient had cancer while in the nursing home and it is unknown whether the patient had cancer when admitted

2. Code the date of admission to the nursing home as the date of diagnosis when

| a. | The only information available is that the patient had cancer when admitted to the nursing home |
|---|---|
| b. | The only information available is that the patient had cancer while in the nursing home, it is unknown whether the patient had cancer when admitted, and there is no basis for approximation |

### Cases Diagnosed Before Birth

Record the actual date of diagnosis for diagnoses made in utero even though this date will precede the date of birth.

***Example:*** Fetal intrahepatic mass consistent with hepatoblastoma diagnosed via ultrasound at 39 weeks gestation (01/30/2024). Live birth by C-section 02/04/2024. Code the date of diagnosis as 01/30/2024. ***Note:*** Prenatal diagnoses are reportable when there is a live birth.

## Sequence Number--Central

#### Item Length: 2 NAACCR Item #: 380 NAACCR Name: Sequence Number--Central XML NAACCR ID: sequenceNumberCentral

*Sequence Number--Central describes the number and sequence of all reportable malignant, in situ, benign,* and borderline primary tumors that occur over the lifetime of a patient. This sequence number counts all tumors that were reportable in the year they were diagnosed even if the tumors occurred before the registry existed or before the registry participated in the SEER Program. See coding instructions below. While the Sequence Number--Hospital (NAACCR Item #560) may be useful in determining Sequence *Number--Central, the two sequence numbers do not have to be identical.* Rules for Determining Multiple Primaries and the reportability requirements for each diagnosis year should be used to decide which primaries need to be sequenced.

### In Situ/Malignant as Federally Required based on Diagnosis Year

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 00 | One primary in the patient's lifetime |
| 01 | First of two or more primaries |
| 02 | Second of two or more primaries |
| .. | .. |
| .. | (Actual number of this primary) |
| .. | .. |
| 59 | Fifty-ninth or higher of fifty-nine or more primaries |
| 99 | Unspecified or unknown sequence number of Federally required in situ or malignant tumors. Sequence number 99 can be used if there is a malignant tumor and its sequence number is |

unknown. (If there is known to be more than one malignant tumor, then the tumors must be sequenced.)

### Non-malignant Tumor as Federally Required based on Diagnosis Year

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 60 | Only one non-malignant tumor or central registry-defined neoplasm |

Unspecified non-malignant tumor or central registry-defined sequence 88 number

\*Series 2 - The only tumors in Series 2 that SEER requires are benign/borderline intracranial and central nervous system (CNS) tumors.

***Note:*** Conversion Guidance Do not change the sequence numbers for neoplasms whose histology codes were associated with behavior codes that changed from in situ/malignant to benign/borderline or vice versa during the conversion from ICD-O-2 to ICD-O-3 or the conversion from ICD-O-3 to ICD-O-3.2.

### In situ/Malignant Coding Instructions

1. Count all previous and current in situ/malignant reportable primaries which occur(red) over the

lifetime of the patient, regardless of where he/she lived at diagnosis a. A 'reportable' primary refers to the site/histology/behavior of the tumor and the years when reporting was required. Review of the reportability requirements in effect during the diagnosis year will be needed.

2. Code 00 when there is only one primary in the patient's lifetime
3. Sequence in situ/malignant primaries chronologically as 01 (first of one or more), 02 (second

primary), 03 (third primary), and assign the appropriate sequence number to all primaries in the database when there are multiple primaries ***Example 1:*** The patient has a history of breast cancer in 1999. She has colon cancer in 2010. Assign sequence number 02 to the colon cancer and change the sequence number on the breast cancer from 00 to 01.

**September 2023 Section IV: Description of this Neoplasm 100**

***Example 2:*** In 1987, patient was diagnosed and treated for childhood leukemia in another state. After becoming a resident of a SEER region, the patient develops bladder cancer. The SEER registry assigns a sequence number of 02 to the bladder cancer. Document the first diagnosis in a text field.

| a. | Change the sequence number of the first primary from 00 to 01 when one patient has a primary with sequence 00 and then develops another reportable /2 or /3 primary |

| b. | Exception: There are certain cancers that were only reportable for some years. The following are some examples (not a complete list) |

- Borderline tumors of the ovary were reported for 1992-2000

`o` Sequence 00-59

- Refractory anemia is reported only for 2001+
- Myelodysplastic syndromes are reported only for 2001+
- Newly reportable hematopoietic neoplasms as of 01/01/2010
4. Assign the lower sequence number to the primary with the worse prognosis when two

**primaries are diagnosed simultaneously**

| a. | Base the prognosis decision on the primary site, histology, and extent of disease for each of the primaries |
|---|---|
| b. | If there is no difference in prognosis, the sequence numbers may be assigned in any order |

### Non-Malignant Coding Instructions

1. Include all non-malignant primary intracranial /CNS tumors diagnosed in 2004, and forward

regardless of where the patient lived at diagnosis

2. Assign sequence number 60 when there are no prior or subsequent non-malignant intracranial/

CNS tumors a. The sequence number is 60 when a patient has only one reportable non-malignant tumor.

If a tumor has a sequence of 60 and there is another reportable non-malignant tumor, change the sequence number of the first primary from 60 to 61.

3. Assign sequence numbers in chronological order according to the order in which they

occur(red). Reportable benign and borderline intracranial/CNS tumors are restricted to primary site codes C700-C729, C751-C753 with behavior codes of /0 or /1.

4. Sequence multiple non-malignant tumors chronologically as 61 (first of two or more), 62

(second), etc.

5. Sequence a non-malignant intracranial/CNS tumor and a malignant intracranial/CNS tumor (/2

or /3) independently when one patient has both. The non-malignant tumor has a sequence number of 60 and the malignant (/2 or /3) tumor has a sequence number of 00.

6. Sequence tumors other than those required by SEER in the 60-87 range when a registry chooses

to collect non-reportable tumors. These non-reportable tumors are often referred to as "Reportable by agreement." ***Example:*** Cervix in situ was diagnosed in 2003 and lung cancer was diagnosed in 2024. The cervix in situ, if collected by the registry, would be a sequence number 60 and the lung would be assigned a sequence number of 00. ***Note:*** Sequence all cervix in situ cases in the 60-87 range regardless of diagnosis year. Submission of in situ cervical cancer is no longer required as of 2018 NCI SEER data submission.

## Primary Site

#### Item Length: 4 NAACCR Item #: 400 NAACCR Name: Primary Site XML NAACCR ID: primarySite

For cases diagnosed 01/01/2001 and later, code the primary site using the topography codes listed in the *International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3). The current Solid Tumor* Rules contain additional coding instructions for some primary sites, including Head and Neck, Lung, and Urinary. ***Note:*** Continue to use ICD-O-3 for assigning topography codes. ICD-O-3.2 did not change any of the topography codes. The ICD-O-3 has topography codes listed in two sections; the first is a numeric listing by code number, the second is an alphabetic listing by anatomic site. The topography code consists of a lead character (the letter 'C') followed by two numeric digits, a decimal point, and then one additional numeric digit. The decimal point is not entered as part of the code. ***Example:*** The pathology report says the primary site is the cardia of the stomach. The code C16.0 is found in the Alphabetic Index under either "stomach" or "cardia." Enter the code as C160; do not record the decimal point.

### Resources for Coding Primary Site for Solid Tumors, in priority order

1. ICD-O
2. SEER Program Manual

a. Including Coding Guidelines in Appendix C

3. Solid Tumor Rules

### Physician Priority Order for Coding Primary Site for Solid Tumors

As a general rule, the surgeon is usually in a better position to determine the site of origin compared to the pathologist. The surgeon sees the tumor in its anatomic location, while the pathologist is often using information given to him/her by the surgeon and looking at a specimen removed from the anatomic landmarks. However, when a pathologist is looking at an entire organ, such as the pancreas, he/she may be able to pinpoint the site of origin within that organ.

***Example: The surgeon states during a pancreatectomy that the primary site is body of pancreas while***

the pathologist states in their CAP Synoptic Reports that the primary site is neck of pancreas. In the case of pancreas body vs. neck, the neck is a thin section of the pancreas located between the head and the body. It may be a matter of opinion whether a tumor is located in the "body" vs. the "neck." In this example, we would give preference to the surgeon and assign the code for body of pancreas, C251.

### Coding Instructions for Solid Tumors

See the Coding Guidelines for Topography and Morphology in the introduction of the ICD-O-3 for additional details. Refer also to the current Solid Tumor Rules for selected primary site coding instructions.

1. Unless otherwise instructed, use all available information in the medical record to code the site
2. Code the site in which the primary tumor originated, even if it extends onto/into an adjacent

subsite

**September 2023 Section IV: Description of this Neoplasm 102**

-----

| a. | Primary site should always be coded to reflect the site of origin according to the medical opinion on the case. Look for information about where the neoplasm originated. Always code the primary site based on where the tumor arose / site of origin. |
|---|---|
| b. | Site of origin may be indicated by terms such as "tumor arose from…," "tumor originated in…," or similar statements |
| c. | Site of origin is not necessarily the site of a biopsy |
| d. | Tumors may involve many sites. The primary site code should reflect the site where the tumor arose rather than all of the sites of involvement. |
| Example | 1: Final diagnosis is adenocarcinoma of the upper lobe of the right lung. Code the |
| topography | to lung, upper lobe (C341). |
| Example | 2: The patient has a 4 cm tumor in the right breast. The tumor originated in the upper |
| inner | quadrant and extends into the lower inner quadrant. Code the primary site to upper inner |
| quadrant | of breast (C502). |
| Example | 3: Patient has a right branchial cleft cyst; the pathology report identifies an |
| adenocarcinoma | arising in an ectopic focus of thyroid tissue within the branchial cleft cyst. |
| Thyroidectomy | pathology is negative. Code the primary site to branchial cleft (C104). |
| Example | 4: The patient had a total hysterectomy with a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ten |
| years | ago for non-cancer reasons. She now has widespread cystadenocarcinoma in the |
| peritoneum. | Code the primary site to peritoneum, NOS (C482). (The chart may or may not state |
| that | the patient has extra-ovarian carcinoma.) |
| Example | 5: Pathology report shows adenocarcinoma arising in a patch of endometriosis on the |
| sigmoid | colon. Code the primary site to sigmoid colon (C187), the site in which the cancer |

originated.

***Example 6: The patient has a left lower lip wedge excision showing invasive squamous cell***

carcinoma at the mucocutaneous junction. There is no further information in operative report or pathology report regarding the location of this tumor that would indicate this is a skin primary. Assign C001, external lower lip. C001 includes vermilion border of lower lip. Vermilion border is synonymous with mucocutaneous junction.

3. Do not adjust the primary site code to fit staging or any other data items
4. Code the last digit of the primary site code to '8' when a single tumor overlaps an adjacent

**subsite(s) of an organ and the point of origin cannot be determined**

***Example:*** The patient has a primary tumor of the cervicothoracic esophagus and the point of origin is unknown. Code the primary site to C158.

***Note:*** **Skin cancers overlapping sites in the head and neck ONLY.**

Assign the primary site code for the site where the bulk of the tumor is or where the epicenter is; do not use code C448.

5. Code the site of the invasive tumor when there is an invasive tumor and also in situ tumor in

different subsites of the same anatomic site ***Example 1:*** Patient has an invasive breast tumor in the upper-outer quadrant of the left breast and in situ tumor in multiple quadrants of the left breast. Code the primary site to C504 (upper outer quadrant of breast). ***Example 2:*** Patient has in situ Paget disease of the right nipple and invasive duct carcinoma of the lower inner quadrant of the right breast. Code the primary site to C503 (lower inner quadrant).

6. Code the last digit of the primary site code to '9' for single primaries, when multiple tumors

**arise in different subsites of the same anatomic site and the point of origin cannot be determined September 2023 Section IV: Description of this Neoplasm 103**

-----

***Example 1:*** During a transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB), the physician describes multiple papillary tumors in the bladder neck (C675) and the lateral wall of the bladder (C672). Code the primary site as bladder, NOS (C679). ***Example 2:*** Patient has an infiltrating duct tumor in the upper outer quadrant (C504) of the right breast and another infiltrating duct carcinoma in the lower inner (C503) quadrant of the right breast. Code the primary site as breast, NOS (C509).

7. Some histology/behavior terms in ICD-O-3.2 have a related site code in parentheses; for

example, hepatoma (C220) a. Code the site as documented in the medical record and ignore the suggested ICD-O-3.2

code when a primary site is specified in the medical record ***Example:*** The path report says "infiltrating duct carcinoma of the head of pancreas." The listing in ICD-O-3.2 is infiltrating duct carcinoma 8500/3 (C50\_). Code the primary site to head of pancreas (C250), NOT to breast (C50\_) as suggested by the ICD-O-3.2. b. Use the site code suggested by ICD-O-3.2 when the primary site is the same as the site

code suggested or the primary site is unknown ***Example 1:*** The biopsy is positive for hepatoma, and no information is available about the primary site. Code the primary site to liver (C220) as suggested by ICD-O-3.2. ***Example 2:*** Excision of the right axillary nodes reveals metastatic infiltrating duct carcinoma. The right breast is negative. ICD-O-3.2 shows infiltrating duct carcinoma (8500) with a suggested site of breast (C50\_). Code the primary site as breast, NOS (C509). c. Use the site code suggested by ICD-O-3.2 when there is no information available

indicating a different primary site ***Example:*** Biopsy of lymph node diagnosed as metastatic non-small cell carcinoma. Patient expired and there is no information available about the primary site. Assign C349 based on the site code suggested in ICD-O-3.2.

8. Code the primary site, not the metastatic site. If a tumor is metastatic and the primary site is

unknown, code the primary site as unknown (C809). a. Code primary site using results of the molecular test CancerTYPE ID only when there is

no other information about the primary site. Document in the text that the site is solely based on results from CancerTYPE ID molecular testing. ***Note:*** CancerTYPE ID tests are a standardized molecular method of determining primary site in tumors initially identified in a metastatic site. The use of CancerTYPE ID to determine primary site is not yet a standard practice and has not received FDA clearance.

9. See the site-specific coding guidelines in Appendix C for primary site coding guidelines for the

following sites

| Anus | Esophagus |
|---|---|
| Bladder | Intracranial Glands |
| Brain/CNS, Benign and Borderline | Kaposi Sarcoma of All Sites |
| Brain/CNS, Malignant | Lung |
| Breast | Pancreas |
| Colon | Rectosigmoid Junction |

10. See section below for primary site coding guidelines for sarcoma
11. Angiosarcoma

a. Code C422 (spleen) as the primary site for angiosarcoma of spleen

**September 2023 Section IV: Description of this Neoplasm 104**

-----

b. Code C50\_ (breast) for angiosarcoma of breast. Although angiosarcoma actually

originates in the lining of the blood vessels, an angiosarcoma originating in the breast has a poorer prognosis than many other breast tumors.

12. Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST): Code the primary site to the location where the GIST

originated

13. Transplants

a. Code the primary site to the location of the transplanted organ when a malignancy arises

in a transplanted organ, i.e., code the primary site to where the malignancy resides or lies ***Example:*** There is a diagnosis of malignancy in transplanted section of colon serving as esophagus. Code the primary site as esophagus. Document the situation in a text field.

| b. | For information about organ or tissue transplants, see the section Determining Multiple Primaries |
|---|---|
| c. | For additional information about hematopoietic-related transplants, refer to the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual and Database |

14. Assign primary site code C449, skin NOS, for a Merkel cell carcinoma presenting in a nodal or

distant metastatic site and site of origin is unknown

15. When the choice is between ovary, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal without designation of

the site of origin, any indication of fallopian tube involvement indicates the primary tumor is a tubal primary. Fallopian tube primary carcinomas can be confirmed by reviewing the fallopian tube sections as described on the pathology report to document the presence of either serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) and/or tubal mucosal invasive serous carcinoma. In the absence of fallopian tube involvement, refer to the histology and look at the treatment plans for the patient. If all else fails, assign C579 as a last resort. For additional information, see the CAP GYN protocol, Table 1: Criteria for assignment of primary site in tubo-ovarian serous carcinomas.

16. In the absence of any additional information about the primary site, assign the codes listed for

these primary sites/histologies

| Primary Site/Histology | Topography Code |
|---|---|
| Ampullary/peri-ampullary | C241 |
| Anal margin | C445 |
| Anal verge | C211 |
| Angle of the stomach | C162 |
| Angular incisura of stomach | C163 |
| Back of tongue | C019 |
| Book-leaf lesion (mouth) | C068 |
| Clavicular skin | C445 |

Colored / lipstick portion of upper lip C000

| Cutaneous leiomyosarcoma | C44_ |
|---|---|
| Distal conus | C720 |
| Edge of tongue | C021 |
| Frontoparietal (brain) | C718 |
| Gastric angular notch (incisura) | C163 |
| Gastrohepatic ligament | C481 |
| Genu of pancreas | C250 |
| Glossotonsillar sulcus | C109 |
| Incisura, incisura angularis | C163 |

**September 2023 Section IV: Description of this Neoplasm 105**

-----

| Primary Site/Histology | Topography Code |
|---|---|
| Infrahilar area of lung | C349 |
| Interarytenoid space | C329 |
| Interhemispheric fissure (cerebrum) | C710 |
| Intracranial | C719 |
| Lateral tongue | C023 |
| Leptomeninges | C709 |
| Masticator space | C760 |
| Melanoma, NOS | C449 |
| Nail bed, thumb | C446 |
| Pancreatobiliary | C269 |
| Parapharyngeal space | C139 |
| Periareolar (breast) | C501 |
| Periclitoral | C511 |
| Perihilar bile duct | C240 |
| Porta hepatis | C220 |

| Preauricular (skin) | C443 |
| Prostatic sinus (urethra) | C680 |
| Testis, descended post orchiopexy | C621 |
| True vocal folds | C320 |
| Uncinate of pancreas | C250 |
| Ureterovesical junction (UVJ) | C669 |

17. When the medical record does not contain enough information to assign a primary

| a. | Consult a physician advisor to assign the site code |
|---|---|
| b. | Use the NOS category for the organ system or the Ill-Defined Sites (C760-C768) if the physician advisor cannot identify a primary site |

***c.*** Occult Tumors of the Head and Neck

i. Assign primary site C119 (nasopharynx) for occult head and neck tumors with

cervical lymph node metastasis in Levels I-VII, and other group lymph nodes positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV+) (regardless of p16 status) encoded small RNAs (EBER) identified by in situ hybridization ii. Assign primary site C109 (oropharynx) for occult head and neck tumors with

cervical lymph node metastasis in Levels I-VII, and other group lymph nodes, p16 positive with histology consistent with HPV-mediated oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) iii. Assign C760 for Occult Head and Neck primaries with positive cervical lymph

nodes. Schema Discriminator 1: Occult Head and Neck Lymph Nodes is used to discriminate between these cases and other uses of C760 For more information about schemas and schema IDs, go to the SSDI Manual, Appendix [A.](https://apps.naaccr.org/ssdi/list/) d. Assign the NOS code for the body system when there are two or more possible primary

sites documented and all are within the same system

**September 2023 Section IV: Description of this Neoplasm 106**

-----

***Example:*** Two possible sites are documented in the GI system such as colon and small intestine; code to the GI tract, NOS (C269). Document the possible primary sites in a text field.

| e. | Code unknown primary site when there is a physician statement of unknown primary site ONLY when none of the above instructions can be applied |
|---|---|
| f. | Code unknown primary site (C809) if there is not enough information to assign an NOS or Ill-Defined Site category |

### Sarcoma

The majority of sarcomas arise in mesenchymal or connective tissues that are located in the musculoskeletal system, which includes the fat, muscles, blood vessels, deep skin tissues, nerves, bones, and cartilage. The default code for sarcomas of unknown primary site is C499 rather than C809. Sarcomas may also arise in the walls of hollow organs and in the viscera covering an organ. Code the

**primary site to the organ of origin.**

***Example 1:*** The pathology identifies a carcinosarcoma of the uterine corpus. Code the primary site to corpus uteri (C549). ***Example 2:*** Rhabdomyosarcoma of ethmoid sinus. Code primary site to C311. Code the organ of origin as the primary site when leiomyosarcoma arises in an organ. Do not code soft tissue as the primary site in this situation.

***Example 1:*** Leiomyosarcoma arises in kidney. Code the primary site to kidney (C649). ***Example 2:*** Leiomyosarcoma arises in prostate. Code primary site to prostate (C619).

### Coding Instructions for Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasms (9590/3-9993/3)

See the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual and Database for instructions on coding the primary site for hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms.

## Laterality

#### Item Length: 1 NAACCR Item #: 410 NAACCR Name: Laterality XML NAACCR ID: laterality

Laterality describes the side of a paired organ or side of the body on which the reportable tumor originated. Determine whether laterality should be coded for each primary.

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 0 | Not a paired site |
| 1 | Right: origin of primary |
| 2 | Left: origin of primary |
| 3 | Only one side involved, right or left origin unspecified |
| 4 | Bilateral involvement at time of diagnosis, lateral origin unknown for a single primary; or both ovaries involved simultaneously, single histology; bilateral retinoblastomas; bilateral Wilms |

tumors 5 Paired site: midline tumor (effective with 01/01/2010 dx) 9 Paired site, but no information concerning laterality

### Coding Instructions

1. Assign code 0 when

| a. | The primary site is not a paired site |
|---|---|
| b. | Primary site is unknown (C809), or |
| c. | Laterality is unknown for a death certificate only (DCO) case and the primary site is NOT one of the primary site codes listed in the table below (Sites for Which Laterality Codes Must Be Recorded) |

2. Code laterality using codes 1-9 for all sites listed in the table: Sites for Which Laterality Codes

Must Be Recorded a. Laterality may be coded for sites other than those required; for example, thyroid

3. Code the side where the primary tumor originated

a. Assign code 3 if the laterality is not known but the tumor is confined to a single side of

the paired organ

***Example: Pathology report: Patient has a 2 cm carcinoma in the upper pole of the***

kidney. Code laterality as 3 because there is documentation that the disease exists in only one kidney, but it is unknown if the disease originated in the right or left kidney.

4. Code 4 is seldom used EXCEPT for the following

| a. | Both ovaries involved simultaneously with a single histology, or epithelial histologies (8000-8799) |
|---|---|
| b. | Diffuse bilateral lung nodules |
| c. | Bilateral retinoblastomas |
| d. | Bilateral Wilms tumors |
| e. | Both breasts when inflammatory carcinoma is bilateral at diagnosis |

**September 2023 Section IV: Description of this Neoplasm 108**

-----

f. Bilateral involvement at time of diagnosis and lateral origin unknown for a site listed in

the table Sites for Which Laterality Must Be Recorded

***Example: Both arms are involved with Kaposi sarcoma and no other sites are involved.***

It is not known on which arm the Kaposi sarcoma originated. Assign Laterality code 4. Skin of upper limb and shoulder is listed as a paired organ in the table Sites for Which *Laterality Must Be Recorded.*

5. Assign code 5 when the tumor originates in the midline of a site listed in 5.a

a. C700, C710-C714, C722-C725, C443, C444, C445

i. Do not assign code 5 to sites not listed in 5.a ***Example 1:*** Patient has an excision of a melanoma located just above the umbilicus (C445, laterality code 5).

***Example 2: Patient has a midline meningioma of the cerebral meninges (C700, laterality***

code 5).

6. Assign code 9 when

a. The neoplasm originated in a paired site and

i. Laterality is unknown, AND ii. There is no statement that only one side of the paired organ is involved ***Example 1:*** Admitting history says patient was diagnosed with lung cancer based on positive sputum cytology. Patient is treated for painful bony metastases. There is no information about laterality in the diagnosis of this lung cancer. ***Example 2:*** Widely metastatic ovarian carcinoma surgically debulked. Ovaries could not be identified in the specimen. b. Laterality is unknown for a death certificate only (DCO) case with primary site code

listed in the table below (Sites for Which Laterality Codes Must Be Recorded)

7. Document the laterality in a text field

### Sites for Which Laterality Codes Must Be Recorded

Starting with cases diagnosed January 1, 2004 and later, laterality is coded for select invasive, benign, and borderline primary intracranial and CNS tumors. A laterality code other than 0 must be assigned for the sites listed in the table below. There is an effective date for assigning laterality for some of the sites. If the site is not listed on the table, code 0 may be assigned for laterality. Laterality may be coded for sites other than those required below. For example: Code 2 may be assigned for a tumor originating in the left lobe of thyroid. ***Note:*** Laterality will be automatically coded to 0 in SEER\*DMS for sites not listed in the table below.

## Diagnostic Confirmation

#### Item Length: 1 NAACCR Item #: 490 NAACCR Name: Diagnostic Confirmation XML NAACCR ID: diagnosticConfirmation

This data item records the best method used to confirm the presence of the cancer being reported. The best method could occur at any time throughout the entire course of the disease. It is not limited to the confirmation at the time of initial diagnosis. ***Note:*** The codes and instructions for hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms are different from the codes for solid tumors. Codes and instructions for solid tumors follow. See the section Codes for Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasms for hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms diagnostic confirmation codes.

### Codes for Solid Tumors

*Microscopically Confirmed*

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Positive histology |
| 2 | Positive cytology |
| 4 | Positive microscopic confirmation, method not specified |

*Not Microscopically Confirmed*

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 5 | Positive laboratory test/marker study |
| 6 | Direct visualization without microscopic confirmation |
| 7 | Radiology and other imaging techniques without microscopic confirmation |
| 8 | Clinical diagnosis only (other than 5, 6, or 7) |

*Confirmation Unknown*

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 9 | Unknown whether or not microscopically confirmed; death certificate only |

### Coding Instructions for Solid Tumors

1. The codes are in priority order; code 1 has the highest priority. Always code the procedure

with the lower numeric value when presence of cancer is confirmed with multiple diagnostic methods.

2. Change to a higher-priority code, if at ANY TIME during the course of disease the patient has a

diagnostic confirmation with a higher priority. Change to the higher-priority code even when diagnostic confirmation is based on the result of subsequent treatment. ***Example:*** Benign brain tumor diagnosed on MRI. Assign diagnostic confirmation code 7. Patient later becomes symptomatic and the tumor is surgically removed. Change diagnostic confirmation code to 1.

3. Assign code 1 when the microscopic diagnosis is based on

a. **Tissue specimens from fine needle aspirate, biopsy, surgery, autopsy, or D&C**

**September 2023 Section IV: Description of this Neoplasm 111**

-----

b. Bone marrow specimens (aspiration and biopsy)

4. Assign code 2 when the microscopic diagnosis is based on

a. Examination of cells (rather than tissue) including but not limited to: sputum smears,

bronchial brushings, bronchial washings, prostatic secretions, breast secretions, gastric fluid, spinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, urinary sediment, cervical smears, or vaginal smears b. Paraffin block specimens from concentrated spinal, pleural, or peritoneal fluid

5. Assign code 4 when there is information that the diagnosis of cancer was microscopically

confirmed, but the type of confirmation is unknown

6. Assign code 5 when the diagnosis of cancer is based on laboratory tests or tumor marker studies

that are clinically diagnostic for that specific cancer and there is no other diagnostic work up (e.g., imaging) ***Example:*** If the workup for a prostate cancer patient is limited to a highly elevated PSA (no DRE and no imaging) and the physician diagnoses and/or treats the patient based only on that PSA, code the diagnostic confirmation to 5. ***Note:*** For tests and tumor markers that may be used to help diagnose cancer, see [https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/diagnosis](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/diagnosis) [https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/diagnosis/tumor-markers-fact-sheet](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/diagnosis/tumor-markers-fact-sheet)

7. Assign code 6 when the diagnosis is based only on

| a. | The surgeon's operative report from a surgical exploration or endoscopy such as colonoscopy, mediastinoscopy, or peritoneoscopy and no tissue was examined |
|---|---|
| b. | Gross autopsy findings (no tissue or cytologic confirmation) |

8. Assign code 7 when the only confirmation of malignancy was diagnostic imaging such as

computerized axial tomography (CT scans), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scans), or ultrasounds/sonography ***Note:*** Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with high grade dysplasia (8453/2) of the pancreas is reportable based on imaging alone; histologic confirmation is not required.

9. Assign code 8 when the case was diagnosed by any clinical method not mentioned in preceding

codes. The diagnostic confirmation is coded 8 when the only confirmation of disease is a physician's clinical diagnosis. ***Example:*** CT diagnosis is possible lung cancer. Patient returns to the nursing home with a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order. Physician enters a diagnosis of lung cancer in the medical record. Code the diagnostic confirmation to 8: there is a physician's clinical diagnosis - clinical diagnosis made by the physician using the information available for the case.

10. Assign code 9

| a. | When it is unknown if the diagnosis was confirmed microscopically |
|---|---|
| b. | For death certificate only case |

## Behavior Code

#### Item Length: 1 NAACCR Item #: 523 NAACCR Name: Behavior Code ICD-O-3 XML NAACCR ID: behaviorCodeIcdO3

The data item Behavior Code describes the malignant potential of the tumor, ranging from /0 benign to /3 malignant (invasive).

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 0 | Benign (Reportable for intracranial and CNS sites only) |
| 1 | Uncertain whether benign or malignant, borderline malignancy, low malignant potential, and uncertain malignant potential (Reportable for intracranial and CNS sites only) |

2 Carcinoma in situ; intraepithelial; noninfiltrating; non-invasive (carcinoma) 3 Malignant, primary site (invasive)

### Coding Instructions

#### General

Code behavior prior to neoadjuvant therapy when given.

#### Intracranial and CNS Tumors

Intracranial and CNS tumors with behavior codes 0 (benign) and 1 (borderline malignancy) are reportable beginning with January 1, 2004 diagnoses. Code the behavior from CT scan, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), or Positron Emission Tomography (PET) report when there is no tissue diagnosis (pathology or cytology report). Code the behavior listed on the scan. Do not use the WHO grade to code behavior.

#### Metastatic or Non-primary Sites

Cases reported to SEER cannot have a metastatic (/6) behavior code. If the only pathologic specimen is from a metastatic site, code the appropriate histology code and the malignant behavior code (/3). The primary site and its metastatic site(s) have the same histology. Code the behavior as malignant (/3) when malignant metastasis is present. Metastasis could be regional, nodal, or distant.

***Example:*** Adenocarcinoma in situ with lymph nodes positive for malignancy. Code the behavior as malignant (/3). When the invasive component cannot be found and there are positive lymph nodes, assign behavior /3 based on the positive lymph nodes. ***Exception:*** For in situ breast cancer; code as non-invasive (/2) in the presence of isolated tumor cells or if cells are artifactually displaced from a previous procedure.

**September 2023 Section IV: Description of this Neoplasm 115**

-----

#### In Situ

Clinical evidence alone cannot identify the behavior as in situ; a behavior code of /2 (in situ) must be based on pathologic examination.

***Exception:*** Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with high grade dysplasia (8453/2) of the pancreas is reportable based on imaging alone; histologic confirmation is not required.

#### In Situ and Invasive

Code the behavior as malignant (/3) if any portion of the primary tumor is invasive no matter how limited, i.e., microinvasion.

***Example:*** Pathology from mastectomy: Large mass composed of intraductal carcinoma with a single focus of invasion. Code the behavior as malignant (/3). Re-code the behavior as malignant (/3) when metastases are attributed to a tumor originally thought to be in situ.

***Example:*** Right colon biopsy reveals tubulovillous adenoma with microfocal carcinoma in situ; right hemicolectomy is negative for residual disease. Later core liver biopsy consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma of gastrointestinal origin. Oncologist states most likely colon primary. Change the behavior code for the colon primary from /2 to /3. There were no other colon primaries in this case.

### ICD-O-3.2 Histology/Behavior Code Listing

Behavior is the fifth digit of the morphology code after the slash (/). The standard reference for coding behavior is the ICD-O-3.2. Pages 27 through 30 in ICD-O-3 discuss behavior. The following general rules are found on pages 29-30 in ICD-O-3.

- Usually a histologic term carries a clear indication of the likely behavior of the tumor, whether

malignant or benign, and this is reflected in the behavior code assigned to it in the ICD-O

- Although only a few histologic types of in situ neoplasms are actually listed in the ICD-O, the

behavior code /2 could be attached to any histology code if an in situ form of the neoplasm is diagnosed

- If the pathologist disagrees with the ICD-O behavior assignment in a particular case, code the

behavior according to the pathologist's description of the behavior even if that histology/behavior combination is not listed in the ICD-O The pathologist has the final say on the behavior of the tumor. ICD-O-3 may have only one behavior code, in situ (/2) or malignant (/3), listed for a specific histology. If the pathology report describes the histology as in situ and the ICD-O-3 histology code is listed only with a malignant behavior code (/3), assign the in situ behavior code (/2). If the pathology report describes histology as malignant and the ICD-O-3 histology code is listed only with an in situ behavior code (/2), assign the malignant behavior code (/3). See the Morphology and Behavior Code Matrix discussion on page 29 in ICD-O-3. ***Example:*** The pathology report says large cell carcinoma in situ. The ICD-O-3 lists large cell carcinoma only with a malignant behavior (8012/3). Code the histology and behavior as 8012/2 as specified by the pathologist.

## Cancer PathCHART Site-Morphology Combination Standards

**About Cancer PathCHART: The Cancer Pathology Coding Histology and Registration Terminology**

(Cancer PathCHART) initiative is a ground-breaking collaboration of North American and global registrar, registry, pathology, and clinical organizations. The main goal of Cancer PathCHART is to improve cancer surveillance data quality by updating standards for tumor site, histology, and behavior code combinations and associated terminology. This initiative involves a substantial, multifaceted review process of histology and behavior codes (and associated terminology) by tumor site that includes expert pathologists and tumor registrars. The results of these in-depth reviews are incorporated into the Cancer PathCHART database, which serves as the single source of truth standards for tumor site, histology, and behavior coding across all standard setters. See the Cancer PathCHART website for further information: [https://seer.cancer.gov/cancerpathchart/.](https://secure-web.cisco.com/1bHHMqNM-dxLSFaI6xSMsDhhxAfOk7J7wHAUbWFCz7sbmSNzCmGMzmjGuKZiFsBg--KW3ygo-x-zw1Vy-vxcG7MAAsr40tdSFz_tCaz4QaC7gsGr6S-U1oHMjhw2axsZRpyIcpUpsaCAlESHlEL7Lyg4Vcrwr2xwOnkF5jsnLN0mufX4KERqu3prVs8ta9gqgw7LQZ4HCGq2RS0ZJ6t7uI31UxhoHQQBA9ixlDzHdUuzsfL73262KepoYcjsD7j_A/https%3A%2F%2Fseer.cancer.gov%2Fcancerpathchart%2F)

**Cancer PathCHART Standards for 2024: Tumor site-morphology combinations are designated as**

valid, unlikely, or impossible. Valid tumor entities can be abstracted without any issues. For cases diagnosed as of January 1, 2024, Impossible tumor entities will trigger an error on the Primary Site, Morphology-Type, Beh ICDO3 2024 (N7040) edit and cannot be abstracted. An alternative site, histology, and behavior combination will need to be coded for the tumor. Unlikely entities will also trigger an error on the N7040 edit. For these combinations, confirm the primary site, histology and behavior code by thoroughly reviewing the medical record. If the information is determined to be correct as coded, the Site/Type Interfield Review override flag will need to be set for the abstract.

**The 2024 Cancer PathCHART ICD-O-3 Site Morphology Validation List: The 2024 Cancer**

PathCHART ICD-O-3 Site Morphology Validation List (CPC SMVL), output directly from the Cancer PathCHART database, is a comprehensive table that replaces both the ICD-O-3 SEER Site/Histology Validation List and the list of impossible site and histology combinations included in the Primary Site, Morphology-Imposs ICDO3 (SEER IF38) edit. The 2024 CPC SMVL is freely available to cancer registration software vendors and any other end users in easily consumed, computer-readable formats (CSV, XLSX, XML, and JSON). The downloadable list can be found at [https://seer.cancer.gov/cancerpathchart/products.html.](https://seer.cancer.gov/cancerpathchart/products.html)

**Cancer PathCHART SVML Search Tool: For January 2024 implementation, a webtool will be**

available on the Cancer PathCHART website that will allow searches for tumor topography, histology, and behavior codes and terms and whether the site-morphology combinations are biologically valid, impossible, or unlikely.

## Tumor Size Summary

#### Item Length: 3 NAACCR Item #: 756 NAACCR Name: Tumor Size Summary XML NAACCR ID: tumorSizeSummary

*Tumor Size Summary is the most accurate measurement of a solid primary tumor, usually measured on the* surgical resection specimen. Tumor size is one indication of the extent of disease. As such, it is used by both clinicians and researchers. Tumor size that is independent of stage is also useful for quality assurance efforts.

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 000 | No mass/tumor found |
| 001 | 1 mm or described as less than 1 mm (0.1 cm or less than 0.1 cm) |
| 002-988 | Exact size in millimeters (2 mm-988 mm) (0.2 cm to 98.8 cm) |
| 989 | 989 millimeters or larger (98.9 cm or larger) |
| 990 | Microscopic focus or foci only and no size of focus is given |
| 998 | Alternate descriptions of tumor size for specific sites: |

Familial/multiple polyposis: -Rectosigmoid and rectum (C19.9, C20.9) -Colon (C18.0, C18.2-C18.9) If no size is documented: Circumferential: -Esophagus (C15.0-C15.5, C15.8, C15.9) Diffuse; widespread: 3/4s or more; linitis plastica: -Stomach and Esophagus GE Junction (C16.0-C16.6, C16.8, C16.9) Diffuse, entire lung or NOS: -Lung and main stem bronchus (C34.0-C34.3, C34.8, C34.9) Diffuse: -Breast (C50.0-C50.6, C50.8, C50.9) 999 Unknown; size not stated; Not documented in patient record; Size of tumor cannot be assessed;

No excisional biopsy or tumor resection done; The only measurement(s) describes pieces or chips; Not applicable

**Note: All measurements should be in millimeters (mm).**

### Coding Instructions

1. Record the size in the specified order

a. Size measured on the surgical resection specimen, when surgery is administered as the

first definitive treatment, i.e., no pre-surgical treatment administered. i. If there is a discrepancy among tumor size measurements in the various sections of

the pathology report, code the size from the synoptic report (also known as CAP protocol or pathology report checklist).

**September 2023 Section IV: Description of this Neoplasm 124**

-----

ii. If only a text report is available, use: final diagnosis, microscopic, or gross

examination, in that order. ***Example 1:*** Chest x-ray shows 3.5 cm mass; the pathology report from the surgery states that the same mass is malignant and measures 2.8 cm. Record tumor size as 028 (28 mm). ***Example 2:*** Pathology report states lung carcinoma is 2.1 cm x 3.2 cm x 1.4 cm. Record tumor size as 032 (32 mm). b. If neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery, do not record the size from the pathologic

specimen. Code the largest size of tumor prior to neoadjuvant treatment; if unknown code size as 999.

***Example: Patient has a 2.2 cm mass in the oropharynx; find needle aspiration of mass***

confirms squamous cell carcinoma. Patient receives a course of neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy. Pathologic size after total resection is 2.8 cm. Record tumor size as 022 (22 mm).

| c. | If no surgical resection, then largest measurement of the tumor from the imaging, physical exam, or other diagnostic procedures in this order of priority prior to any other form of treatment. |
|---|---|
| d. | If a, b, and c do not apply, the largest size from all information available within four months of the date of diagnosis, in the absence of disease progression. |

2. Tumor size is the diameter of the tumor, not the depth or thickness of the tumor.
3. Record tumor size stated less than or greater than as follows

a. If tumor size is reported as less than x mm or less than x cm, the reported tumor size

should be 1 mm less ***Examples:*** Tumor size is stated as: < 1 cm, code as 009; < 2 cm, code as 019, < 3 cm, code as 029; < 4 cm, code as 039; < 5 cm is coded as 049. If stated as less than 1 mm, use code 001. b. If tumor size is reported as more than or greater than x mm or more than x cm, code size

as 1 mm more ***Examples:*** Tumor size is stated as: >10 mm or >1 cm, code as 011; > 2 cm, code as 021; > 3 cm, code as 031; > 4 cm, code as 041; > 5 cm, code as 051. If described as anything greater than 989 mm (98.9 cm), code as 989. c. If tumor size is reported to be between two sizes, record tumor size as the midpoint

between the two: i.e., add the two sizes together and then divide by two ***Examples:*** Tumor size is between 2 and 3 cm, code as 025. Code size as 025 since 2 + 3 =5 divided by 2 = 2.5 cm (or 025 mm).

4. Record the higher tumor size when stated as a range

***Example: Tumor size is 8-10 mm or tumor size is 8 to 10 mm.*** Code size as 010 since 10 mm is the higher of the values in the range.

5. Round the tumor size only if it is described in fractions of millimeters

| a. | When tumor size is greater than 1 millimeter, round tenths of millimeters in the 1-4 range down to the nearest whole millimeter and round tenths of millimeters in the 5-9 range up to the nearest whole millimeter. See Exception for breast cancer. |
|---|---|
| b. | Do not round tumor size expressed in centimeters to the nearest whole centimeter; rather, convert the measurement to millimeters by moving the decimal point one space to the right |

**September 2023 Section IV: Description of this Neoplasm 125**

-----

***Note 1:*** Record tumor size as 001 (do not round down to 000) when the largest dimension of a tumor is less than 1 millimeter (between 0.1 and 0.9 mm). ***Note 2:*** Code 001 when tumor size is 1 mm. ***Exception to rounding rules for BREAST primaries:*** Round tumor sizes greater than 1.0 mm and up to 2.4 mm to 2 mm (002). The purpose of this exception is so that the size recorded in the Tumor Size data item will derive the correct AJCC TNM Primary Tumor (T) category for breast primaries. Do not apply this instruction to any other site.

#### Examples:

Breast cancer described as 6.5 millimeters in size. Round up to 7 mm and code as 007. Breast cancer described as 1.3 mm in size. Round up to 2 mm and code as 002. 2.3 millimeters cancer in a polyp. Round down to 2 mm and code 002. Hypopharynx: Focus of cancer described as 1.4 mm in size. Round down to 1 mm and code as 001. 5.2 cm breast cancer. Convert to millimeters and code 052. 2.5 cm rectal cancer. Do not round, record as 025 millimeters.

6. Priority of imaging/radiographic technique

| a. | Use information on size from imaging/radiographic techniques to code the tumor size when there is no more specific size information from pathology or operative report. It should be taken as a lower priority, but over a physical exam. |
|---|---|
| b. | Record the largest size in the record when there are tumor size discrepancies among imaging and radiographic reports, regardless of the imaging technique reports unless the physician specifies which imaging is most accurate |

7. Code the size of the primary tumor, not the size of the polyp, ulcer, cyst, or distant metastasis.

However, if the tumor is described as a "cystic mass" and only the size of the entire mass is given, code the size of the entire mass, since the cysts are part of the tumor itself.

8. Record the size of the invasive component, if given.

a. If both an in situ and an invasive component are present and the invasive component is

measured, record the size of the invasive component even if it is smaller

***Example: Tumor is mixed in situ and invasive adenocarcinoma, total 3.7 cm in size, of***

which 1.4 cm is invasive. Record tumor size as 014 (14 mm)

b. If the size of the invasive component is not given, record the size of the entire tumor from

the surgical report, pathology report, radiology report, or clinical examination. ***Example 1:*** A breast tumor with infiltrating duct carcinoma with extensive in situ component; total size 2.3 cm. Record tumor size as 023 (23 mm). ***Example 2:*** Duct carcinoma in situ measuring 1.9 cm with an area of invasive ductal carcinoma. Record tumor size as 019 (19 mm)

9. Record the largest dimension or diameter of tumor, whether it is from an excisional biopsy

specimen or the complete resection of the primary tumor ***Example 1:*** Tumor is described as 2.4 x 5.1 x 1.8 cm in size. Record tumor size as 051 (51 mm). ***Example 2:*** Anal canal tumor is 2.5 cm from proximal to distal (3.5 cm in circumference). Record tumor size as 035. The circumferential measurement is the largest measurement in this example. In this case, the pathologist usually cuts the anus and rectum open like a tube; the circumference is measured flat.

**September 2023 Section IV: Description of this Neoplasm 126**

-----

10. Record the size as stated for purely in situ lesions
11. Multifocal/multicentric tumors: Code the size of the largest invasive tumor, or the largest in

situ tumor if all tumors are in situ, when the tumor is multi-focal or when multiple tumors are reported as a single primary.

12. Assign code 000 when

a. No residual tumor is found

i. Neoadjuvant therapy has been administered and the resection shows no residual

**tumor**

| b. | Schema is Cervical Lymph Nodes and Unknown Primary 00060 |
|---|---|
| c. | EOD Primary Tumor is coded 800 (No evidence of primary tumor) for any schema except for those listed in Coding Instruction 14 |

13. Assign tumor size for benign and borderline tumors in the schemas Brain, CNS Other,

Intracranial Gland, and Medulloblastoma when provided; do not default to 999

14. Assign code 999 when

a. Size is unknown and for the following sites and schemas/schema IDs

i. Any case coded to primary site C420, C421, C423, C424, C770-C779, or C809 ii. HemeRetic 00830

1. Excluding Spleen (C422) iii. Kaposi Sarcoma 00458 iv. Lymphoma 00790 v. Lymphoma-CLL/SLL 00795 vi. Melanoma Choroid and Ciliary Body 00672 vii. Melanoma Iris 00671 viii. Plasma Cell Disorders 00822 ix. Plasma Cell Myeloma 00821 b. The only measurement describes pieces or chips in a pathology report. Do not add the

size of pieces or chips together to create a whole; they may not be from the same location, or they may represent only a very small portion of a large tumor. However, when the pathologist states an aggregate or composite size (determined by fitting the tumor pieces together and measuring the total size), record that size.

| c. | The only measurement is for calcifications that span given distance or a cluster of microcalcifications. Do not record the size of calcifications as tumor size. If there is no measurement of the mass or tumor, record 999. |
|---|---|
| d. | Neoadjuvant therapy has been administered and resection was performed. Do not use a post-neoadjuvant size to code pathologic tumor size; however, you may use the clinical tumor size if available. |

15. Document the information to support coded tumor size in the appropriate text data item of the

abstract

## Mets at Diagnosis--Other

#### Item Length: 1 NAACCR Item #: 1117 NAACCR Name: Mets at DX-Other XML NAACCR ID: metsAtDxOther

The six Mets at Diagnosis-metastatic sites data items provide information on metastases for data analysis. This data item identifies any type of distant involvement not captured in the Mets at Diagnosis--Bone, Mets

***at Diagnosis--Brain, Mets at Diagnosis--Liver, Mets at Diagnosis--Lung, and Mets at Diagnosis--Distant*** ***Lymph Nodes data items. It includes involvement of other specific sites and more generalized*** **metastases such as carcinomatosis. Some examples include but are not limited to the adrenal gland, bone**

marrow, pleura, malignant pleural effusion, peritoneum, and skin.

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 0 | None; no other metastases |
| 1 | Yes; distant metastases in known site(s) other than bone, brain, liver, lung, or distant lymph nodes |

***Note:*** includes bone marrow involvement for lymphomas 2 Generalized metastases such as carcinomatosis 8 Not applicable 9 Unknown whether any other metastatic site or generalized metastases

Not documented in patient record

### Coding Instructions

1. **Code information about other metastases only (discontinuous or distant metastases)**

identified at the time of diagnosis. This data item should not be coded for bone, brain, liver, lung, or distant lymph node metastases.

| a. | Other involvement may be single or multiple |
|---|---|
| b. | Information about other involvement may be clinical or pathological |
| c. | Code this data item whether or not the patient had any preoperative (neoadjuvant) systemic therapy unless determined to be disease progression |

d. Code this data item for all solid tumor schemas (including Kaposi Sarcoma and Ill-

Defined Other [includes unknown primary site]) and the following Hematopoietic schemas except as noted in 2.d. and 2.e . i. Lymphoma Ocular Adnexa 00710 ii. Lymphoma 00790 (see 2.d.) iii.

Includes a clinical or pathologic statement that there are no other metastases iv. Includes imaging reports that are negative for other metastases v. Indicates that the patient has distant (discontinuous) metastases but other sites are

not mentioned as involved

***Example:*** **Use code 0 when the patient has metastasis to lung and liver only.**

Use code 1 when the medical record indicates i. Distant (discontinuous) metastases in any site(s) other than bone, brain, liver, lung,

or distant lymph node(s)

1. Includes, but not limited to, the adrenal gland, bone marrow, pleura,

malignant pleural effusion, peritoneum, and skin ii. Lymphomas with bone marrow involvement (Stage IV disease)

***Note:*** Does not include lymphomas or lymphoma/leukemias where primary site is C421 (bone marrow). Use code 2 when the medical record i. Indicates that the patient has carcinomatosis

1. Carcinomatosis is a condition in which cancer is spread widely throughout

the body, or, in some cases, to a relatively large region of the body

***Note: It is possible to have metastatic disease to a specific organ AND also have***

carcinomatosis. If a patient has metastatic disease to bone, brain, liver, lung or distant nodes AND carcinomatosis, use code 1 for the appropriate data item (bone, brain, liver, lung, or distant nodes) and use code 2 for carcinomatosis. If a patient has metastatic disease to a site other than bone, brain, liver, lung or distant nodes AND carcinomatosis, assign code 2 for carcinomatosis. Code 2 for carcinomatosis takes priority. ***Example 1:*** Patient with breast cancer noted to have mets to the liver and carcinomatosis. Code "Mets at Diagnosis--Liver" as 1 and "Mets at Diagnosis-- *Other" as 2.* ***Example 2:*** Patient with colon cancer noted to have mets to the stomach and carcinomatosis. Code "Mets at Diagnosis--Other" as 2 for carcinomatosis. Use code 8 (Not applicable) for the following i. Any case coded to primary site C420, C421, C423, or C424 ii. Plasma Cell Disorders 00822 Use code 9 when it cannot be determined whether the patient has metastases other than bone, brain, liver, lung, or distant lymph node(s) For more information about schemas and schema IDs, go to the SSDI Manual, Appendix A.

### Coding Instructions

1. Record the results of any HPV testing performed on pathological specimens including surgical

and cytological (from cell blocks) tissue from the primary tumor or a metastatic site, including lymph nodes. Do not record the results of blood tests or serology.

2. There are several methods for determination of HPV status. The most frequently used test is

IHC for p16 expression which is a surrogate marker for HPV infection. Other tests (based on ISH, PCR, RT-PCR technologies) detect the viral DNA or RNA.

3. HPV-type 16 refers to virus type and is different from p16 overexpression (p16+)
4. Codes 10-51 are hierarchical; use the highest code that applies (10 is highest, 51 is lowest)

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 162**

-----

## First Course of Therapy

This section applies to all neoplasms (including benign and borderline intracranial and CNS tumors) except hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms. For information regarding first course of therapy for hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms, refer to the NCI SEER Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual.

### Definitions

**Active surveillance:** A treatment plan that involves closely watching a patient's condition but not giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results that show the condition is getting worse. Active surveillance may be used to avoid or delay the need for treatments such as radiation therapy or surgery, which can cause side effects or other problems. During active surveillance, certain exams and tests are done on a regular schedule. It may be used in the treatment of certain types of cancer, such as prostate cancer, urethral cancer, and intraocular (eye) melanoma. It is a type of expectant management. Also called active monitoring. (Source: http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=616060) **Cancer tissue:** Proliferating malignant cells; an area of active production of malignant cells. Cancer tissue includes primary tumor and metastatic sites where cancer tissue grows. Cells in fluid such as pleural fluid or ascitic fluid are not "cancer tissue" because the cells do not grow and proliferate in the fluid. **Concurrent therapy:** A treatment that is given at the same time as another.

***Example:*** Chemotherapy and radiation therapy **Deferred therapy:** Closely watching a patient's condition but not giving treatment unless symptoms appear or change, or there are changes in test results. Deferred therapy avoids problems that may be caused by treatments such as radiation or surgery. It is used to find early signs that the condition is getting worse. During deferred therapy, patients may be given certain exams and tests. It is sometimes used in prostate cancer. Also called expectant management. (Source: http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=667618) **Disease recurrence:** For solid tumors, see the Solid Tumor Rules and for hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms see the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual and Database to determine disease recurrence. **Expectant management:** Closely watching a patient's condition but not giving treatment unless symptoms appear or change, or there are changes in test results. Expectant management avoids problems that may be caused by treatments such as radiation or surgery. It is used to find early signs that the condition is getting worse. During expectant management, patients may be given certain exams and tests. It is sometimes used in prostate cancer. Also called deferred therapy. (Source: http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=616061)

**First course of therapy: All treatments administered to the patient after the original diagnosis of cancer in**

an attempt to destroy or modify the cancer tissue. See below for detailed information on timing and treatment plan documentation requirements. **Hospice:** A program that provides special care for people who are near the end of life and for their families, either at home, in freestanding facilities, or within hospitals. Hospice care may include treatment that destroys or modifies cancer tissue. If performed as part of the first course, treatment that destroys or modifies cancer tissue is collected when given in a hospice setting. "Hospice, NOS" is not specific enough to be included as first course treatment. **Neoadjuvant therapy:** Systemic therapy or radiation therapy given prior to surgery to shrink the tumor.

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 163**

-----

**Palliative treatment:** The World Health Organization describes palliative care as treatment that improves the quality of life by preventing or relieving suffering. ***Note:*** Palliative therapy is part of the first course of therapy only when it destroys or modifies cancer

**tissue.**

***Example:*** The patient was diagnosed with stage IV cancer of the prostate with painful bone metastases. The patient starts radiation treatment intended to shrink the tumor in the bone and relieve the intense pain. The radiation treatments are palliative because they relieve the bone pain; the radiation is also first course of therapy because it destroys proliferating cancer tissue. **Surgical procedure:** Any surgical procedure coded in the data items Surgery of Primary Site 2023, Scope of *Regional Lymph Node Surgery (excluding code 1), or Surgical Procedure of Other Site.* **Treatment:** Procedures that destroy or modify primary (primary site) or secondary (metastatic) cancer tissue.

**Treatment failure:** The treatment modalities did not destroy or modify the cancer cells. The tumor either became larger (disease progression) or stayed the same size after treatment. **Watchful waiting:** Closely watching a patient's condition but not giving treatment unless symptoms appear or change. Watchful waiting is sometimes used in conditions that progress slowly. It is also used when the risks of treatment are greater than the possible benefits. During watchful waiting, patients may be given certain tests and exams. Watchful waiting is sometimes used in prostate cancer. It is a type of expectant management. (Source: http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=45942)

### Treatment Timing

Use the following instructions in hierarchical order

1. Use the documented first course of therapy (treatment plan) from the medical record. First

course of therapy ends when the treatment plan is completed no matter how long it takes to complete the plan unless there is documentation of disease progression, recurrence, or treatment failure (see #2 below). ***Example:*** Hormonal therapy (e.g., Tamoxifen) after surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. First course ends when hormonal therapy is completed, even if this takes years, unless there is documentation of disease progression, recurrence, or treatment failure (see #2 below).

2. First course of therapy ends when there is documentation of disease progression, recurrence,

**or treatment failure**

***Example 1:*** The documented treatment plan for sarcoma is pre-operative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy, followed by surgery, then radiation or chemotherapy depending upon the pathology from surgery. Scans show the tumor is not regressing after pre-operative chemotherapy. Plans for surgery are cancelled, radiation was not administered, and a different type of chemotherapy is started. Code only the first chemotherapy as first course. Do not code the second chemotherapy as first course because it is administered after documented treatment failure. ***Example 2:*** The documented treatment plan for a patient with locally advanced breast cancer includes mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiation to the chest wall and axilla, and hormone therapy. The patient has the mastectomy and completes chemotherapy. During the course of radiation therapy, the liver enzymes are rising. Workup proves liver metastases. The physician stops the radiation and does not continue with hormone therapy (the treatment plan is altered). The patient is placed on a clinical trial to receive Herceptin for metastatic breast cancer. Code

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 164**

-----

the mastectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation as first course of treatment. Do not code the Herceptin as first course of therapy because it is administered after documented disease progression.

3. When there is no documentation of a treatment plan or progression, recurrence or a treatment

failure, first course of therapy ends one year after the date of diagnosis. Any treatment given

**after one year is second course of therapy in the absence of a documented treatment plan or a standard of treatment.**

### Coding Instructions

1. Code all treatment data items to 0 or 00 (Not done) when the physician opts for active

**surveillance, deferred therapy, expectant management, or watchful waiting. When the**

disease progresses or the patient becomes symptomatic, any prescribed treatment is second course. a. Code Treatment Status (RX Summ--Treatment Status) to 2

2. Code the treatment as first course of therapy if the patient refuses treatment but changes his/her

mind and the prescribed treatment is implemented less than one year from the date of diagnosis, AND there is no evidence of disease progression

3. The first course of therapy is no treatment when the patient refuses all treatment. Code all

treatment data items to Refused. a. Keep the refused codes even if the patient later changes his/her mind and decides to have

the prescribed treatment i. more than one year after diagnosis, or ii. when there is evidence of disease progression before treatment is implemented

4. Code all treatment that was started and administered, whether completed or not. Document

treatment discontinuation in text fields. ***Example:*** The patient completed only the first dose of a planned 30-day chemotherapy regimen. Code chemotherapy as administered.

5. Code the treatment on each abstract when a patient has multiple primaries and the treatment

given for one primary also affects/treats another primary ***Example 1:*** The patient had prostate and bladder cancer. The bladder cancer was treated with a TURB. The prostate cancer was treated with radiation to the prostate and pelvis. The pelvic radiation includes the regional lymph nodes for the bladder. Code the radiation as treatment for both the bladder and prostate cases. ***Example 2:*** The patient had a hysterectomy for ovarian cancer. The pathology report reveals a previously unsuspected microinvasive cancer of the cervix. Code the hysterectomy as surgical treatment for both the ovarian and cervix primaries.

6. Code the treatments only for the site that is affected when a patient has multiple primaries and

the treatment affects only one of the primaries ***Example:*** The patient has colon and tonsil primaries. The colon cancer is treated with a hemicolectomy and the tonsil primary is treated with radiation to the tonsil and regional nodes. Do not code the radiation for the colon. Do not code the hemicolectomy for the tonsil.

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 165**

-----

7. Code the treatment given as first course even if the correct primary is identified later when a

patient is diagnosed with an unknown primary ***Example:*** The patient is diagnosed with metastatic carcinoma, unknown primary site. After a full course of chemotherapy, the primary site is identified as prostate. Code the chemotherapy as first course of treatment.

8. Do not code treatment as first course when it is added to the plan after the primary site is

discovered. This is a change in the treatment plan. ***Example:*** The patient is diagnosed with metastatic carcinoma, unknown primary site. After a full course of chemotherapy, the primary site is identified as prostate. Hormonal treatment is started. Code the chemotherapy as first course of treatment. The hormone therapy is second course because it was not part of the initial treatment plan.

9. For information regarding first course of therapy for hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms,

refer to the NCI SEER Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasm Coding Manual.

## Surgery of Primary Site 2023

#### Item Length: 4 NAACCR Item #: 1291 NAACCR Name: RX Summ--Surg Prim Site 2023 XML NAACCR ID: rxSummSurgPrimSite2023

*Surgery of Primary Site 2023, effective 01/01/2023, describes a surgical procedure that removes and/or* destroys tissue of the primary site that is performed as part of the initial diagnostic and staging work-up or first course of therapy. Site- specific surgery codes are included under Appendix C of this manual.

### General Coding Structure

(See Appendix C for site-specific codes.)

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| A000 | None; no surgical procedure of primary site; diagnosed at autopsy only |
| A100-A190 | Site-specific codes. Tumor destruction; no pathologic specimen or unknown whether there is a pathologic specimen |
| A200-A800 | Site-specific codes. Resection; pathologic specimen |
| A900 | Surgery, NOS. A surgical procedure to the primary site was done, but no information on the type of surgical procedure is provided. |

| A980 | Special codes for hematopoietic neoplasms; ill-defined sites; and unknown primaries (See site-specific codes for the sites and histologies), except death certificate only |
|---|---|
| A990 | Unknown if surgery performed |

Use the entire operative report as the primary source document to determine the best surgery of primary site code. The body of the operative report will designate the surgeon's planned procedure as well as a description of the procedure that was actually performed. The pathology report may be used to complement the information appearing in the operative report, but the operative report takes precedence.

### Coding Instructions

1. Code A000 or B000 when

| a. | No surgery was performed on the primary site, OR |
|---|---|
| b. | First course of treatment was active surveillance/watchful waiting, OR |
| c. | Case was diagnosed at autopsy |
| Note: | Codes A000 and B000 exclude all sites and histologies that are coded A980. (See Coding |
| Instruction | 11 below.) |

2. Use the site-specific coding scheme corresponding to the primary site or histology
3. Code the most invasive, extensive, or definitive surgery if the patient has multiple surgical

procedures of the primary site even if there is no residual tumor found in the pathologic specimen from the more extensive surgery ***Example:*** Patient has a needle biopsy of prostate that is positive for adenocarcinoma. The patient chooses to have a radical prostatectomy. The pathologic examination of the prostatectomy specimen shows no residual tumor. Code the radical prostatectomy.

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 173**

-----

4. Code an excisional biopsy, even when documented as incisional, when

| a. | All disease is removed (margins free), OR |
|---|---|
| b. | All gross disease is removed and there is only microscopic residual at the margin |
| Note: | Do not code an incisional biopsy as an excisional biopsy when there is macroscopic |
| residual | disease. |

5. Code total removal of the primary site when a previous procedure resected a portion of the

site and the current surgery removed the rest of the organ. The previous procedure may have been cancer directed or non-cancer directed surgery. ***Example:*** Left thyroidectomy for suspicious nodules. Path showed papillary carcinoma. Completion thyroidectomy was performed. Code surgery of primary site as total thyroidectomy (A500).

6. Assign the code that reflects the cumulative effect of all surgeries to the primary site.

a. When a previous surgical procedure to remove a portion of the primary site is followed

by surgery to remove the remainder of the primary site, code the total or final results. Do not rely on registry software to perform this task. ***Example:*** The patient underwent a partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy, followed by an axillary lymph node dissection for the first right breast primary in 2011. The separate 2020 right breast primary was treated with a total mastectomy and removal of one involved axillary lymph node. The operative report only refers to this as a non-sentinel lymph node, with no mention of other axillary findings. Cumulatively, this patient has undergone a modified radical mastectomy since there were likely no remaining axillary lymph nodes. For the 2020 primary, code the cumulative effect of the surgery done in 2011 plus the surgery performed in 2020. Use text fields on both abstracts to record the details.

7. Code the removal of regional or distant tissue/organs when they are resected in continuity with

the primary site (en bloc) and that regional organ/tissue is listed in the Surgery of Primary Site *2023 codes. Specimens from an en bloc resection may be submitted to pathology separately.* ***Example:*** Code an en bloc removal when the patient has a hysterectomy and an omentectomy.

8. Code surgery for extra-lymphatic lymphoma using the site-specific surgery coding scheme for

the primary site. Do not use the lymph node scheme.

9. Assign the surgery code(s) that best represents the extent of the surgical procedure that was

actually carried out when surgery is aborted. If the procedure was aborted before anything took place, assign code A000. See 1.a. above.

10. Code A800, B800, A900, or B900 only when there is no specific information
11. Code A980 for the following primary sites unless the case is death certificate only (see #13

below) a. Any case coded to C420, C421, C423, C424, C760-C768, or C809

12. When Surgery of Primary Site 2023 is coded A980

| a. | Code Surgical Margins of the Primary Site (#1320) to 9 |
|---|---|
| b. | Code Reason for No Surgery of Primary Site (#1340) to 1 |

13. Code A990 or B990 for death certificate only (DCO) cases or if patient record does not state

whether a surgical procedure of the primary site was performed (i.e., is unknown)

14. Leave blank for diagnosis years 2003-2022

### Coding Instructions

1. Immediate reconstruction is defined as reconstruction performed during the same operative

session as the operative procedure coded in Surgery of Primary Site 2023 (NAACCR Item #1291)

2. One surgeon can perform the surgical resection to primary site and another surgeon can perform

the reconstruction during the same operative session. As long as reconstruction was done during the same operative session, an immediate reconstruction code should be assigned.

## Surgical Margins of the Primary Site

#### Item Length: 1 NAACCR Item #: 1320 NAACCR Name: RX Summ--Surgical Margins XML NAACCR ID: rxSummSurgicalMargins

*Surgical Margins of the Primary Site describes the final status of the surgical margins after resection of the* primary tumor. This item serves as a quality measure for pathology reports, is used for staging, and may be a prognostic factor in recurrence. It applies to all cases that have a surgical procedure of the primary site.

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 0 | No residual tumor |
| 1 | Residual tumor, NOS |
| 2 | Microscopic residual tumor |
| 3 | Macroscopic residual tumor |
| 7 | Margins not evaluable |
| 8 | No primary site surgery |
| 9 | Unknown or not applicable |

***Note:*** Codes were site-specific from 1998 to 2002, and have been changed to be generic across all disease sites.

### Coding Instructions

1. Assign code 0 when all margins are negative both microscopically and macroscopically

(grossly)

2. Codes 0-3 are hierarchical

a. Assign the numerically higher code if two codes describe the margin status

3. Assign code 1 for involvement of margins but not otherwise specified

## Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery

#### Item Length: 1 NAACCR Item #: 1292 NAACCR Name: RX Summ--Scope Reg LN Sur XML NAACCR ID: rxSummScopeRegLnSur

*Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery describes the procedure of removal, biopsy, or aspiration of regional* lymph nodes performed during the initial work-up or first course of therapy. Instructions for coding sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNBx) have been clarified for 2012 and later, diagnoses. Additional instructions for breast primaries (C500-C509) are described below, following the general coding instructions.

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 0 | No regional lymph nodes removed or aspirated; diagnosed at autopsy. |
| 1 | Biopsy or aspiration of regional lymph node, NOS |
| 2 | Sentinel lymph node biopsy [only] |
| 3 | Number of regional lymph nodes removed unknown, not stated; regional lymph nodes removed, NOS |

4 1 to 3 regional lymph nodes removed 5 4 or more regional lymph nodes removed 6 Sentinel node biopsy and code 3, 4, or 5 at same time or timing not noted 7 Sentinel node biopsy and code 3, 4, or 5 at different times 9 Unknown or not applicable

### Coding Instructions

1. Use the entire operative report as the primary source document to determine whether the

operative procedure was a SLNBx, or a more extensive dissection of regional lymph nodes, or a combination of both SLNBx and regional lymph node dissection. The body of the operative report will designate the surgeon's planned procedure as well as a description of the procedure that was actually performed. The pathology report may be used to complement the information appearing in the operative report, but the operative report takes precedence when attempting to distinguish between SLNBx and regional lymph node dissection or a combination of these two procedures. Do not use the number of lymph nodes removed and pathologically examined as the sole means of distinguishing between a SLNBx and a regional lymph node dissection.

2. Code regional lymph node procedures in this data item. Record distant lymph node removal in

*Surgical Procedure of Other Site.* a. Include lymph nodes that are regional in the current AJCC Staging Manual or EOD 2018

3. Record all surgical procedures that remove, biopsy, or aspirate regional lymph node(s) whether

or not there were any surgical procedures of the primary site. The regional lymph node surgical procedure(s) may be done to diagnose cancer, stage the disease, or as a part of the initial

**treatment.**

***Example:*** Patient has a sentinel node biopsy of a single lymph node. Assign code 2 (Sentinel lymph node biopsy [only]).

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 178**

-----

4. Include lymph nodes obtained or biopsied during any procedure within the first course of

treatment. A separate lymph node surgery is not required. a. Code the removal of intra-organ lymph nodes in Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery ***Example:*** Local excision of breast cancer. Specimen includes an intra-mammary lymph node. Assign code 4 (1 to 3 regional lymph nodes removed).

5. Add the number of all of the lymph nodes removed during each surgical procedure performed

as part of the first course of treatment. The Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery data item is

**cumulative.**

***Example:*** Patient has excision of a positive cervical node. The pathology report from a subsequent node dissection identifies three cervical nodes. Assign code 5 (4 or more regional lymph nodes removed). a. Lymph node aspirations

i. Do not double-count when a regional lymph node is aspirated and that node is in

the resection field. Do not add the aspirated node to the total number. ii. Count as an additional node when a regional lymph node is aspirated and that node

is NOT in the resection field. Add it to the total number. iii. Assume the lymph node that is aspirated is part of the lymph node chain surgically

removed and do not include it in the count when its location is not known

6. Code the removal of regional nodes for both primaries when the patient has two primaries with

**common regional lymph nodes**

***Example:*** Patient has a cystoprostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for bladder cancer. Pathology identifies prostate cancer as well as the bladder cancer and 4/21 nodes positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma. Code Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery to 5 (4 or more regional lymph nodes removed) for both primaries.

7. Assign the appropriate code for occult head and neck primaries with positive cervical lymph

**nodes (schema 00060). Do not default to code 9 for this schema.**

8. Assign code 0 when

a. Regional lymph node removal procedure was not performed

***Note:*** Excludes all sites and histologies that would be coded 9. (See Coding Instruction #13 below.)

#### OR OR

b. First course of treatment was active surveillance/watchful waiting c. The operative report lists a lymph node dissection, but no nodes were found by the

pathologist

9. Assign code 2 when

| a. | The operative report states that a SLNBx was performed OR |
|---|---|
| b. | The operative report describes a procedure using injection of a dye, radio label, or combination to identify a lymph node (possibly more than one) for removal/examination |
| Note: | When a SLNBx is performed, additional non-sentinel nodes can be taken during the |
| same | operative procedure. These additional non-sentinel nodes may be discovered by the |
| pathologist | or selectively removed (or harvested) as part of the SLNBx procedure by the |

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 179**

-----

surgeon. Code this as a SLNBx (code 2). If review of the operative report confirms that a regional lymph node dissection followed the SLNBx, code these cases as 6.

10. Codes 3, 4, and 5: The operative report states that a regional lymph node dissection was

performed (a SLNBx was not done during this procedure or in a prior procedure)

| a. | Code 3: Check the operative report to ensure this procedure is not a SLNBx only (code 2), or a SLNBx with a regional lymph node dissection (code 6 or 7) |
|---|---|
| b. | Code 4 should be used infrequently. Review the operative report to ensure the procedure was not a SLNBx only. |
| c. | Code 5: If a relatively small number of nodes was examined pathologically, review the operative report to confirm the procedure was not a SLNBx only (code 2). If a relatively large number of nodes was examined pathologically, review the operative report to confirm that there was not a SLNBx in addition to a more extensive regional lymph node |

dissection during the same, or separate, procedure (code 6 or 7).

***Note: Infrequently, a SLNBx is attempted and the patient fails to map (i.e., no sentinel lymph***

nodes are identified by the dye and/or radio label injection). When mapping fails, surgeons usually perform a more extensive dissection of regional lymph nodes. Code these cases as 2 if no further dissection of regional lymph nodes was undertaken, or 6 when regional lymph nodes were dissected during the same operative event.

11. Code 6: SLNBx and regional lymph node dissection (code 3, 4, or 5) during the same surgical

event, or timing not known

| a. | Generally, SLNBx followed by a regional lymph node completion will yield a relatively large number of nodes. However, it is possible for these procedures to harvest only a few nodes. |
|---|---|
| b. | If relatively few nodes are pathologically examined, review the operative report to confirm whether the procedure was limited to a SLNBx only |
| c. | Infrequently, a SLNBx is attempted and the patient fails to map (i.e., no sentinel lymph nodes are identified by the dye and/or radio label injection). When mapping fails, the surgeon usually performs a more extensive dissection of regional lymph nodes. Code these cases as 6. |

12. Code 7: SLNBx and regional lymph node dissection (code 3, 4, or 5) in separate surgical events

| a. | Generally, SLNBx followed by regional lymph node completion will yield a relatively large number of nodes. However, it is possible for these procedures to harvest only a few nodes. |
|---|---|
| b. | If relatively few nodes are pathologically examined, review the operative report to confirm whether the procedure was limited to a SLNBx only |

13. Code 9: The status of regional lymph node evaluation should be known for surgically treated

cases (i.e., cases coded A190-A900 or B190-B900 in the data item Surgery of Primary Site *2023 (NAACCR Item #1291). Review surgically treated cases coded as 9 in Scope of Regional* *Lymph Node Surgery to confirm the code.* a. Assign code 9 for

i. Any case coded to primary site: C420, C421, C423, C424, C589, C700-C709,

C710-C729, C751-C753, C761-C768, C770-C779, or C809

### Coding Instructions - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNBx), breast primary C500-C509

1. Use the entire operative report as the primary source document to determine whether the

operative procedure was a SLNBx, an axillary node dissection (ALND), or a combination of

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 180**

-----

both SLNBx and ALND. The body of the operative report will designate the surgeon's planned procedure as well as a description of the procedure that was actually performed. The pathology report may be used to complement the information appearing in the operative report, but the operative report takes precedence when attempting to distinguish between SLNBx and ALND, or a combination of these two procedures. Do not use the number of lymph nodes removed and pathologically examined as the sole means of distinguishing between a SLNBx and an ALND.

2. Code 1

a. Excisional biopsy or aspiration of regional lymph nodes for breast cancer is uncommon.

Review the operative report to confirm whether an excisional biopsy or aspiration of regional lymph nodes was actually performed; it is highly possible that the procedure is a SLNBx (code 2) instead. If additional procedures were performed on the lymph nodes, such as axillary lymph node dissection, use the appropriate code 2-7.

3. Code 2

| a. | If a relatively large number of lymph nodes, more than 5, are pathologically examined, review the operative report to confirm the procedure was limited to a SLNBx and did not include an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) |
|---|---|
| b. | Infrequently, a SLNBx is attempted and the patient fails to map (i.e., no sentinel lymph nodes are identified by the dye and/or radio label injection) and no sentinel nodes are removed. Review the operative report to confirm that an axillary incision was made and a node exploration was conducted. Patients undergoing SLNBx who fail to map will often undergo ALND. Use code 2 if no ALND was performed, or 6 when ALND was |

performed during the same operative event. Enter the appropriate number of nodes examined and positive in the data items Regional Nodes Examined (NAACCR Item #830) and Regional Nodes Positive (NAACCR Item #820).

4. Codes 3, 4, and 5: Generally, ALND removes at least 7-9 nodes. However, it is possible for

these procedures to remove or harvest fewer nodes. Review the operative report to confirm that there was not a SLNBx in addition to a more extensive regional lymph node dissection during the same procedure (code 6 or 7).

5. Code 6

| a. | Generally, SLNBx followed by ALND will yield a minimum of 7-9 nodes. However, it is possible for these procedures to harvest fewer (or more) nodes. |
|---|---|
| b. | If relatively few nodes are pathologically examined, review the operative report to confirm whether the procedure was limited to a SLNBx, or whether a SLNBx plus an ALND was performed |

6. Code 7

| a. | Generally, SLNBx followed by ALND will yield a minimum of 7-9 nodes. However, it is possible for these procedures to harvest fewer (or more) nodes. |
|---|---|
| b. | If relatively few nodes are pathologically examined, review the operative report to confirm whether the procedure was limited to a SLNBx only, or whether a SLNBx plus an ALND was performed |

## Regional Nodes Positive

#### Item Length: 2 NAACCR Item #: 820 NAACCR Name: Regional Nodes Positive XML NAACCR ID: regionalNodesPositive

### Description

*Regional Nodes Positive records the exact number of regional nodes examined by the pathologist and found* to contain metastasis. This data item must be collected on all cases.

| Codes | Description |
|---|---|
| 00 | All nodes examined are negative |
| 01-89 | 1-89 nodes are positive (code exact number of nodes positive) |
| 90 | 90 or more nodes are positive |
| 95 | Positive aspiration OR core biopsy of lymph node(s) was performed |
| 97 | Positive nodes are documented, but the number is unspecified |
| 98 | No nodes were examined |
| 99 | It is unknown whether nodes are positive; not applicable; not stated in patient record |

### Coding Instructions

1. **Regional lymph nodes only. Record information only about regional lymph nodes in this data**

item. a. Include lymph nodes that are regional in the current AJCC Staging Manual or EOD

*Regional Nodes*

2. **This data item is based on pathological information only, including autopsy. This data item**

is to be recorded regardless of whether the patient received neoadjuvant (preoperative) treatment. Information from the autopsy may be used to code Regional Nodes Positive. Use text fields to explain the situation.

3. True in situ cases cannot have positive lymph nodes, so the only allowable codes are 00

(negative) or 98 (not examined). Codes 01-97 and 99 are not allowed.

4. **Nodes positive is cumulative. Record the total number of regional lymph nodes removed and**

found to be positive by pathologic examination. Record lymph nodes removed and found to be positive during an autopsy for autopsy-only cases.

| a. | The number of regional nodes positive is cumulative from all procedures that remove lymph nodes through the completion of surgeries in the first course of treatment |
|---|---|
| b. | Do not count a positive aspiration or core biopsy of a lymph node in the same lymph node chain removed at surgery as an additional node in Regional Nodes Positive when there are positive nodes in the resection. In other words, when there are positive regional lymph nodes in a lymph node dissection, do not count the core needle biopsy or the fine |

needle aspiration if it is in the same chain. See also Use of Code 95 below. ***Example 1:*** Lung cancer patient has a mediastinoscopy and positive core biopsy of a hilar lymph node. Patient then undergoes right upper lobectomy that yields 3 hilar and 2 mediastinal nodes positive out of 11 nodes dissected. Code Regional Nodes Positive as

#### 05 and Regional Nodes Examined as 11 because the core biopsy was of a lymph node in the same chain as the nodes dissected.

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 187**

-----

***Example 2:*** Positive right cervical lymph node aspiration followed by right cervical lymph node dissection showing 1 of 6 nodes positive. Code Regional Nodes Positive as

**01 and Regional Nodes Examined as 06.**

c. Include the node in the count of Regional Nodes Positive when the positive aspiration or

core biopsy is from a node in a different node region ***Example:*** Breast cancer patient has a positive core biopsy of a supraclavicular node and an axillary dissection showing 3 of 8 nodes positive. Code Regional Nodes Positive as

**04 and Regional Nodes Examined as 09 because the supraclavicular lymph node is in a different, but still regional, lymph node chain.**

d. Assume the lymph node that is core-biopsied or aspirated is part of the lymph node chain

surgically removed and do not include it in the count of Regional Nodes Positive when its location is not known ***Example:*** Patient record states that lymph node core biopsy was performed at another facility and 7/14 regional lymph nodes were positive at the time of resection. Code

***Regional Nodes Positive as 07 and Regional Nodes Examined as 14.***

5. **Priority of lymph node counts.** Use information in the following priority when there is a

discrepancy regarding the number of positive lymph nodes

| a. | Final diagnosis |
|---|---|
| b. | Synoptic report (also known as CAP protocol or pathology report checklist; the consolidated findings on the CAP protocol) |

| c. | Microscopic description |
|---|---|
| d. | Gross description |

#### 6. Positive nodes in multiple primaries in same organ

a. Determine the histology of the metastases in the nodes and code the nodes as positive for

the primary with that histology when there are multiple primary cancers with different histologic types in the same organ and the pathology report just states the number of nodes positive b. Code the nodes as positive for all primaries when no further information is available

***Example:*** A breast case is two separate primaries as determined by the SEER multiple primary rules. The pathology report states "3 of 11 lymph nodes positive for metastasis" with no further information available. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 03 and Regional

***Nodes Examined as 11 for both primaries.***

#### 7. Isolated Tumor Cells (ITCs) in lymph nodes

a. For all cases except cutaneous melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma of skin

i. Count only lymph nodes that contain micrometastases or larger (metastases greater

than 0.2 millimeters in size) ii. Assume the metastases are larger than 0.2 mm and count the lymph node(s) as

positive when the path report indicates that nodes are positive but the size of metastasis is not stated iii. Do not include in the count of lymph nodes positive any nodes that are identified

as containing ITCs b. For cutaneous melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma of skin

i. Count nodes with ITCs as positive lymph nodes

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 188**

-----

8. Use code 95 when

| a. | The only procedure for regional lymph nodes is a needle aspiration (cytology) or core biopsy (tissue) |
|---|---|
| b. | A positive lymph node is aspirated and there are no surgically resected lymph nodes Example: Patient with esophageal cancer. Enlarged mid-esophageal node found on CT scan, which is aspirated and found to be positive. Patient undergoes radiation therapy and no surgery. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 95 and Regional Nodes Examined as 95. |

c. A positive lymph node is aspirated and surgically resected lymph nodes are negative

***Example:*** Lung cancer patient has aspiration of suspicious hilar mass that shows metastatic squamous carcinoma in lymph node tissue. Patient undergoes neoadjuvant (preoperative) radiation therapy followed by lobectomy showing 6 negative hilar lymph nodes. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 95 and Regional Nodes Examined as the 06

**nodes surgically resected.**

9. Code 97. Use code 97 for any combination of positive aspirated, biopsied, sampled, or dissected

lymph nodes when the number of involved nodes cannot be determined on the basis of cytology or histology. Code 97 includes positive lymph nodes diagnosed by either cytology or histology. ***Example:*** Patient with carcinoma of the pyriform sinus has a mass in the mid neck. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of one node is positive. The patient has neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy, then resection of the primary tumor and a radical neck dissection. In the radical neck dissection, "several" of 10 nodes are positive; the remainder of the nodes show chemotherapy effect. Code Regional Nodes Positive as 97 because the total number of

**positive nodes biopsied and removed is unknown, and code Regional Nodes Examined as** **10.** ***Note: If the aspirated node is the only one that is microscopically positive, use code 95.***

10. Use code 98 when

| a. | The assessment of lymph nodes is clinical only |
|---|---|
| b. | No lymph nodes are removed and examined |
| c. | A "dissection" of a lymph node drainage area is found to contain no lymph nodes at the time of pathologic examination |

d. *Regional Nodes Positive is coded 98, Regional Nodes Examined is usually coded 00*

11. Use code 99 for

| a. | Any case coded to primary site C420, C421, C423, C424, C589, C700-C709, C710- C729, C751-C753, C761-C768, C770-C779, or C809 |

## Reason for No Surgery of Primary Site

#### Item Length: 1 NAACCR Item #: 1340 NAACCR Name: Reason for No Surgery XML NAACCR ID: reasonForNoSurgery

This data item records the reason that surgery of the primary site was not part of the first course of treatment.

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 0 | Surgery of the primary site was performed |
| 1 | Surgery of the primary site was not performed because it was not part of the planned first-course treatment |

2 Surgery of the primary site was not recommended/performed because it was contraindicated due

to patient risk factors (comorbid conditions, advanced age, progression of tumor prior to planned surgery, etc.) 5 Surgery of the primary site was not performed because the patient died prior to planned or

recommended surgery 6 Surgery of the primary site was not performed; it was recommended by the patient's physician,

but was not performed as part of the first course of therapy. No reason was noted in the patient's record. 7 Surgery of the primary site was not performed; it was recommended by the patient's physician,

but was refused by the patient, the patient's family member, or the patient's guardian. The refusal was noted in the patient record. 8 Surgery of the primary site was recommended, but it is unknown if it was performed. Further

follow up is recommended. 9 It is unknown if surgery of the primary site was recommended or performed; DCO and autopsy

only cases

### Coding Instructions

1. Assign code 0 when Surgery of Primary Site 2023 is coded in the range of A100-A900 or B100-

B900 (surgery of the primary site was performed)

2. Assign code 1 when Surgery of Primary Site 2023 is coded A980 (not applicable). For Autopsy

Only cases, see coding instruction #4.

3. Assign a code in the range of 1-8 when Surgery of Primary Site 2023 is coded A000 or B000

***Note:*** **Referral to a surgeon is equivalent to a recommendation for surgery.**

a. Assign code 1 when

i. Primary site is C420, C421, C423, C424, C760-C768, or C809

***Note:*** Surgery is not standard treatment for these cases. ii. There is no information in the patient's medical record about surgery, AND

- It is known that surgery is not usually performed for this type and/or stage

of cancer OR

- There is no reason to suspect that the patient would have had surgery of

primary site

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 195**

-----

***Example:*** The patient would not be a surgical candidate because of advanced stage. iii. The treatment plan offered multiple treatment options and the patient selected

treatment that did not include surgery of the primary site ***Example:*** Prostate cancer patient is offered three treatment options: a. Radical prostatectomy, b. Radiation therapy, or c. Hormone therapy. The patient chose to have radiation therapy. Assign code 1. Surgery of the primary site was not performed because it was not part of the planned first course of treatment. The treatment plan was for the patient to receive ONE of three treatment modality options: surgery, OR radiation, OR hormone therapy. At no time did the physician recommend that the patient have surgery AND radiation therapy AND hormone therapy. The patient chose radiation. This does not mean he refused surgery because at no time did the treatment plan include both radiation AND surgery. Recording that a patient refused the treatment modality means that the patient refused recommended therapy. This is a quality control check explaining why the patient did not receive the expected treatment for their cancer (patient's choice versus physician's choice, or facility's lack of providing quality care). iv. Surgery was part of the first course of treatment but was cancelled due to complete

response to radiation and/or systemic therapy v. Patient elected to pursue no treatment following the discussion of surgery.

Discussion does not equal a recommendation. Patient's decision not to pursue surgery is not a refusal of surgery in this situation. vi. Active surveillance/watchful waiting is the first course (e.g., prostate) b. Assign code 2 when surgery of the primary site is contraindicated due to factors

including, but not limited to, comorbid conditions, advanced age, and progression of tumor prior to planned surgery ***Example:*** Patient with metastatic cancer from the right kidney to the lung has a history of prior left nephrectomy with a current history of congestive heart disease and smoking. Surgery is not performed for the right kidney malignancy because the patient is considered a surgical risk. c. Assign code 6 when

i. It is KNOWN that surgery was recommended

#### AND

ii. It is KNOWN that surgery was not performed

#### AND

iii. There is no documentation explaining why surgery was not done ***Example:*** The medical record has a recommendation that the patient have surgery. No further admissions or documentation of surgery found; the primary care physician replies that the patient did NOT have surgery. No further information is given; it is unknown

**if the patient refused surgery or if there were co-morbid conditions that prevented the surgical procedure.**

d. Assign code 7 when the patient

i. Refuses recommended surgery

#### OR

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 196**

-----

ii. Makes a blanket statement that he/she refused all treatment when surgery is a

customary option according to NCCN guidelines and/or the NCI PDQ for the primary site/histology

- Assign code 1 when surgery is not normally performed for the site/histology ***Note:*** Coding Reason for No Surgery of Primary Site as "refused" does not affect the coding of the other treatment data items (e.g., Radiation, Chemotherapy, Hormone *Therapy, etc.). Code 7 means surgery is exactly what was recommended by the physician* and the patient refused. If two treatment alternatives were offered and surgery was not chosen, code Reason for No Surgery of Primary Site as 1 [Surgery of the primary site was not performed because it was not part of the planned first-course treatment]. e. Assign code 8 when surgery is recommended, but it is unknown if the patient actually

had the surgery ***Example:*** There is documentation in the medical record that the primary care physician referred the patient to a surgical oncologist. Follow-back to the surgical oncologist and primary care physician yields no further information. Assign code 8, it is known that surgery was recommended but there is no information on whether or not the patient actually had the surgical procedure.

***Note: Review cases coded 8 periodically for later confirmation of surgery.***

4. Assign code 9

| a. | When there is no documentation that surgery was recommended or performed |
|---|---|
| b. | For death certificate only (DCO) cases |
| c. | Autopsy only cases |

| 01 | External beam, NOS | The treatment is known to be by external beam, but there is insufficient |

information to determine the specific planning technique 02 Low energy x- External beam therapy administered using equipment with a maximum

ray/photon therapy energy of less than one (1) million volts (MV). Energies are typically

expressed in units of kilovolts (kV). These type of treatments are sometimes referred to as electronic brachytherapy or orthovoltage or superficial therapy. Clinical notes may refer to the brand names of low energy x-ray delivery devices, e.g., Axxent®, INTRABEAM®, or Esteya®. 03 2-D therapy An external beam planning technique using 2-D imaging, such as plain

film x-rays or fluoroscopic images, to define the location and size of the treatment beams. Should be clearly described as 2-D therapy. This planning modality is typically used only for palliative treatments. 04 Conformal or 3-D An external beam planning technique using multiple, fixed beams

conformal therapy shaped to conform to a defined target volume. Should be clearly

described as conformal or 3-D therapy in patient record. 05 Intensity modulated An external beam planning technique where the shape or energy of

therapy beams is optimized using software algorithms. Any external beam

modality can be modulated but these generally refer to photon or proton beams. Intensity modulated therapy can be described as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), intensity modulated x-ray or proton therapy (IMXT/IMPT), volumetric arc therapy (VMAT) and other ways. If a treatment is described as IMRT with online reoptimization/re-planning, then it should be categorized as online reoptimization or re-planning.

#### Description

Treatment planning using stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery techniques, but the treatment is not described as CyberKnife® or Gamma Knife®. These approaches are sometimes described as SBRT (stereotactic body radiation), SABR (stereotactic ablative radiation), SRS (stereotactic radiosurgery), or SRT (stereotactic radiotherapy). If the treatment is described as robotic radiotherapy (e.g., CyberKnife®) or Gamma Knife ®, use stereotactic radiotherapy subcodes below. If a treatment is described as stereotactic radiotherapy or radiosurgery with online re-optimization/re-planning, then it should be categorized as online re-optimization or re-planning. Treatment planning using stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery techniques which is specifically described as robotic (e.g., CyberKnife®) Treatment planning using stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery techniques which uses a Cobalt-60 gamma ray source and is specifically described as Gamma Knife®. This is most commonly used for treatments in the brain. An external beam technique in which the treatment plan is adapted over the course of radiation to reflect changes in the patient's tumor or normal anatomy radiation using a CT scan obtained at the treatment machine (online). These approaches are sometimes described as CTguided online re-optimization or online re-planning. If a treatment technique is described as both CT-guided online adaptive therapy as well as another external beam technique (IMRT, SBRT, etc.), then it should be categorized as CT-guided online adaptive therapy. If a treatment is described as "adaptive" but does not include the descriptor "online," this code should not be used. An external beam technique in which the treatment plan is adapted over the course of radiation to reflect changes in the patient's tumor or normal anatomy radiation using an MRI scan obtained at the treatment machine (online). These approaches are sometimes described as MRguided online re-optimization or online re-planning. If a treatment technique is described as both MR-guided online adaptive therapy as well as another external beam technique (IMRT, SBRT, etc.), then it should be categorized as MR-guided online adaptive therapy. If a treatment is described as "adaptive" but does not include the descriptor "online," this code should not be used. Treatment not by external beam Other radiation, NOS; Radiation therapy administered, but the treatment modality is not specified or is unknown It is unknown whether radiation therapy was administered

- Radiation external beam treatment planning technique will typically be found in the radiation

oncologist's summary letter. Determination of the external beam planning technique may require assistance from the radiation oncologist to ensure consistent coding.

- The first phase may be commonly referred to as an initial plan and a subsequent phase may be

referred to as a boost or cone down, and would be recorded as Phase II, Phase III, etc., accordingly

- In keeping with contemporary practice, modern radiotherapy allows phases to be delivered

simultaneously so new terminology is needed. Each phase is meant to reflect a "delivered radiation prescription." At the start of the radiation planning process, physicians write radiation prescriptions to treatment volumes and specify the dose per fraction (session), the number of

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 201**

-----

fractions, the modality, and the planning technique. A phase simply represents the radiation prescription that has actually been delivered (as sometimes the intended prescription differs from the delivered prescription).

- Phases can be delivered sequentially or simultaneously. In sequential phases, a new phase begins

when there is a change in the anatomic target volume of a body site, treatment fraction size (i.e., dose given during a session), modality, or treatment technique. Any one of these changes will generally mean that a new radiation plan will be generated in the treatment planning system and should be coded as a new phase of radiation therapy. ***Note:*** "Online adaptive therapy" refers to treatment where radiation treatment plans are adapted or updated while a patient is on the treatment table. When treatment plans are adapted, the shape of the target volume may change from day to day but, for registry purposes, the volume that is being targeted will not change. An adapted plan should not be coded as though a new phase of treatment has been initiated unless, as above, the radiation oncologist documents it as a new phase in the radiation treatment summary. Two new technique codes have been added to capture when online adaptive therapy is occurring: CT-guided and MR-guided adaptive therapy.

***Note: Use the date of diagnosis, not the date of treatment, to determine whether to code these drugs as***

chemotherapy or BRM/Immunotherapy.

***Example 1:*** Patient diagnosed with HER2 positive breast cancer December 15, 2023, and was placed on planned Herceptin February 2, 2024. Code Herceptin in the BRM/Immunotherapy data item (as the patient was diagnosed after January 1, 2013). ***Example 2:*** Patient diagnosed with breast cancer November 1, 2012, and begins receiving Rituximab January 30, 2013, as part of first course therapy. Code the Rituximab in the Chemotherapy data item because the patient was diagnosed prior to January 1, 2013.

### Definitions

**Chemotherapy recommended: A consult recommended chemotherapy, or the attending physician**

documented that chemotherapy was recommended. A referral to a clinical oncologist is equivalent to a recommendation.

**Multiple agent chemotherapy: Planned first course of therapy included two or more chemotherapeutic**

agents and those agents were administered. The planned first course of therapy may or may not have included other agents such as hormone therapy, immunotherapy, or other treatment in addition to the chemotherapeutic agents.

**Single agent chemotherapy: Only one chemotherapeutic agent was administered to destroy cancer tissue**

during the first course of therapy. The chemotherapeutic agent may or may not have been administered with other drugs classified as immunotherapy, hormone therapy, ancillary, or other treatment.

### Coding Instructions

1. Code the chemotherapeutic agents whose actions are chemotherapeutic only; do not code the

method of administration

2. When chemotherapeutic agents are used as radiosensitizers or radioprotectants, they are given at

a much lower dosage and do not affect the cancer. Radiosensitizers and radioprotectants are classified as ancillary drugs. See SEER\*Rx. Do not code as chemotherapy. Review the radiation-oncology progress notes for information about radiosensitizing chemotherapy.

***Note: Do not assume that a chemo agent given with radiation therapy is a radiosensitizer. Seek***

additional information. Compare the dose given to the dose normally given for treatment. For additional information, see

3. The physician may change a drug during the first course of therapy because the patient cannot

tolerate the original agent a. This is a continuation of the first course of therapy when the chemotherapeutic agent that

is substituted belongs to the same group (alkylating, antimetabolites, natural products, targeted therapy, or other miscellaneous)

| b. | Do not code the new agent as first course therapy when the original chemotherapeutic agent is changed to one that is NOT in the same group. Code only the original agent as first course. When the new agent is in a different group, it is second course therapy. |
|---|---|
| c. | Use SEER*Rx and compare the subcategory of each chemotherapy agent to determine whether or not they belong to the same group (subcategory). See "Chemotherapeutic Agents" below for the groups and their definitions. |

4. Code as treatment for both primaries when the patient receives chemotherapy for invasive

carcinoma in one breast and also has an invasive or in situ carcinoma in the other breast. Chemotherapy would likely affect both primaries.

***Example: Patient is diagnosed with infiltrating duct carcinoma, stage III, in the right breast and***

infiltrating duct carcinoma, stage I, in the left breast. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is administered for the stage III neoplasm in the right breast per the breast surgeon consult, but not for the left breast. Code the chemotherapy on both abstracts for both primaries in this case (simultaneous bilateral breast primaries).

5. Assign code 00 when

| a. | The medical record documents chemotherapy was not given, was not recommended, or was not indicated |
|---|---|
| b. | There is no information in the patient's medical record about chemotherapy, AND |

i. It is known that chemotherapy is not usually performed for this type and/or stage

of cancer

#### OR

ii. There is no reason to suspect that the patient would have had chemotherapy

| c. | The treatment plan offered multiple treatment options and the patient selected treatment that did not include chemotherapy |
|---|---|
| d. | Patient elects to pursue no treatment following the discussion of chemotherapy. Discussion does not equal a recommendation. Patient's decision not to pursue chemotherapy is not a refusal of chemotherapy in this situation. |
| e. | Active surveillance/watchful waiting is the first course of treatment (e.g., CLL) |
| f. | Patient diagnosed at autopsy |
| Example: | Patient is diagnosed with plasma cell myeloma. There is no mention of treatment or |
| treatment | plans in the medical record. Follow-back finds that the patient died three months after |
| diagnosis. | There are no additional medical records or other pertinent information available. |
| Assign | code 00 since there is no reason to suspect that the patient had been treated. |

6. Do not code combination of ancillary drugs administered with single agent chemotherapeutic

agents as multiple chemotherapy. For example, the administration of 5-FU (antimetabolite) and Leucovorin (ancillary drug) is coded to single agent (Code 02).

7. Assign code 82 when chemotherapy is a customary option for the primary site/histology but it

was not administered due to patient risk factors, such as

| a. | Advanced age |
|---|---|
| b. | Comorbid condition(s) (heart disease, kidney failure, other cancer, etc.) |
| c. | Progression of tumor prior to administration |

8. Assign code 87 when

a. The patient refused recommended chemotherapy

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 210**

-----

| b. | The patient made a blanket refusal of all recommended treatment and chemotherapy is a customary option for the primary site/histology |
|---|---|
| c. | The patient refused all treatment before any was recommended and chemotherapy is a customary option for the primary site/histology |

9. Assign code 88 when the only information available is

| a. | The patient was referred to an oncologist |

10. Assign code 99 when there is no documentation that chemotherapy was recommended or

administered a. For death certificate only (DCO) cases

### Chemotherapeutic Agents

Chemotherapeutic agents are chemicals that affect cancer tissue by means other than hormonal manipulation. Chemotherapeutic agents can be divided into five groups.

- Alkylating agents
- Antimetabolites
- Natural products
- Targeted therapy
- Miscellaneous

#### Alkylating Agents

Alkylating agents are not cell-cycle-specific. Although they are toxic to all cells, they are most active in the resting phase of the cell. Alkylating agents directly damage DNA to prevent the cancer cell from reproducing. Alkylating agents are used to treat many different cancers including acute and chronic leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, multiple myeloma, sarcoma, and cancers of the lung, breast, and ovary. Because the drugs damage DNA they can cause long-term damage to the bone marrow and can, in rare cases, lead to acute leukemia. The risk of leukemia from alkylating agents is "dose-dependent." Examples of alkylating agents include

- Mustard gas derivatives/nitrogen mustards: mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil,

melphalan, and ifosfamide

- Ethylenimines: thiotepa and hexamethylmelamine
- Alkylsulfonates: busulfan
- Hydrazines and Trizines: altretamine, procarbazine, dacarbazine, and temozolomide
- Nitrosureas: carmustine, lomustine, streptozocin, and nitrosourea are unique because they can

cross the blood-brain barrier and can be used in treating brain tumors

- Metal salts: carboplatin, cisplatin, and oxaliplatin

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 211**

-----

#### Antimetabolites

Antimetabolites are cell-cycle specific. Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell. When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they are unable to divide. Antimetabolites are classified according to the substances with which they interfere.

- Folic acid antagonist: methotrexate
- Pyrimidine antagonist: 5-fluorouracil, floxuridine, cytarabine, capecitabine, and gemcitabine
- Purine antagonist: 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine
- Adenosine deaminase inhibitor: ladribine, fludarabine, nelarabine, and pentostatin

#### Natural Products

1. Plant Alkaloids are cell-cycle specific which means they attack the cells during various phases

of division. They block cell division by preventing microtubule function. Microtubules are vital for cell division. Without them, division cannot occur. Plant alkaloids, as the name implies, are derived from certain types of plants.

- Vinca alkaloids: vincristine, vinblastine, and vinorelbine
- Taxanes: paclitaxel and docetaxel
- Podophyllotoxins: etoposide and teniposide
- Camptothecan analogs: irinotecan and topotecan
2. Antitumor antibiotics are also cell-cycle specific and act during multiple phases of the cell

cycle. They are made from natural products and were first produced by the soil fungus Streptomyces. Antitumor antibiotics form free radicals that break DNA strands, stopping the multiplication of cancer cells.

- Anthracyclines: doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin, mitotane, and idarubicin
- Chromomycins: dactinomycin and plicamycin
- Miscellaneous: mitomycin and bleomycin
3. Topoisomerase inhibitors interfere with the action of topoisomerase enzymes (topoisomerase I

and II). They control the manipulation of the structure of DNA necessary for replication.

- Topoisomerase I inhibitors: irinotecan, topotecan
- Topoisomerase II inhibitors: amsacrine, etoposide, etoposide phosphate, teniposide

#### Targeted Therapy

Targeted cancer therapies are drugs or other substances that block the growth and spread of cancer by interfering with specific molecules ("molecular targets") that are involved in the growth, progression, and spread of cancer. Targeted cancer therapies are sometimes called "molecularly targeted drugs," "molecularly targeted therapies," "precision medicines," or similar names. Examples of molecularly targeted therapy are imatinib (Gleevec), lapatinib (Tykerb), erlotinib (Tarceva), sunitinib (Sutent).

#### Miscellaneous

Miscellaneous antineoplastics that are unique

- Ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor: hydroxyurea
- Adrenocortical steroid inhibitor: mitotane

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 212**

-----

- Enzymes: asparaginase and pegaspargase
- Antimicrotubule agent: estramustine
- Retinoids: bexarotene, isotretinoin, tretinoin (ATRA)

### Coding for Tumor Embolization

The American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), and the SEER Program have collaborated to clarify and refine coding directives for tumor embolization and are jointly issuing the following instructions.

### Definitions

**Chemoembolization: A procedure in which the blood supply to the tumor is blocked surgically or**

mechanically and anticancer drugs are administered directly into the tumor. This permits a higher concentration of drug to be in contact with the tumor for a longer period of time.

**Radioembolization: Tumor embolization combined with the injection of small radioactive beads or coils**

into an organ or tumor.

**Tumor embolization: The intentional blockage of an artery or vein to stop the flow of blood through the**

desired vessel.

### Coding Instructions

Code as Chemotherapy when the embolizing agent(s) is a chemotherapeutic drug(s). Use SEER\*Rx to determine whether the drugs used are classified as chemotherapeutic agents. Use codes 01, 02, 03 as specific information regarding the agent(s) is documented. ***Example:*** The patient has hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer). From a procedure report: Under x-ray guidance, a small catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin. The catheter's tip is threaded into the artery in the liver that supplies blood flow to the tumor. Chemotherapy is injected through the catheter into the tumor and mixed with particles that embolize or block the flow of blood to the tumor.

**Do not code pre-surgical (pre-operative) embolization of hypervascular tumors with agents such as particles,**

coils, or alcohol as a treatment. Pre-surgical embolization is typically performed to prevent excess bleeding during the resection of the primary tumor. Examples where pre-surgical embolization is used include meningiomas, hemangioblastomas, paragangliomas, and renal cell metastases in the brain.

### Definitions

Immunotherapy is designed to 1. Make cancer cells more recognizable and therefore more susceptible to destruction by the immune system

2. Boost the killing power of immune system cells, such as T-cells, NK-cells, and macrophages

3. Alter the growth patterns of cancer cells to promote behavior like that of healthy cells

4. Block or reverse the process that changes a normal cell or a pre-cancerous cell into a cancerous

#### cell

5. Enhance the body's ability to repair or replace normal cells damaged or destroyed by other

forms of cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy or radiation

#### 6. Prevent cancer cells from spreading to other parts of the body

#### Types of Immunotherapy

**Cancer Treatment Vaccines: Also called therapeutic vaccines, are a type of immunotherapy. The vaccines**

work to boost the body's natural defenses to fight a cancer. Doctors give treatment vaccines to people already diagnosed with cancer. The vaccines may:

- Prevent cancer from returning
- Destroy any cancer cells still in the body after other treatment
- Stop a tumor from growing or spreading Please refer to SEER\*Rx to determine how to code non-FDA approved vaccines.

**Interferons: Interferons belong to a group of proteins called cytokines. They are produced naturally by the**

white blood cells in the body. Interferon-alpha is able to slow tumor growth directly as well as activate the immune system. It is used for a number of cancers including multiple myeloma, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), hairy cell leukemia, and malignant melanoma.

**Interleukins (IL-2) are often used to treat kidney cancer and melanoma. Monoclonal Antibodies: Monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) are produced in a laboratory. The artificial**

antibodies are used in a variety of ways in systemic therapy and can be chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or ancillary drugs. Some are injected into the patient to seek out and disrupt cancer cell activities. When the monoclonal antibody disrupts tumor growth, it is coded as chemotherapy. Other Mabs are linked to radioisotopes (conjugated monoclonal antibodies). The Mab finds and attaches to the target tumor cells and brings with it the radioisotope that actually kills the tumor cell. The monoclonal antibody itself does nothing to enhance the immune system. Conjugated monoclonal antibodies such as tositumomab (Bexxar) or ibritumomab (Zevalin) are coded to the part of the drug that actually kills the cells, usually radioisotopes. A

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 220**

-----

third function of Mab is to enhance the immune response against the cancer, either by identifying tumor cells that are mimicking normal cells, or by boosting the body's natural defenses that destroy foreign cells. Consult SEER\*Rx for the treatment category in which each monoclonal antibody should be coded.

administered 99 It is unknown if a transplant procedure or endocrine therapy was recommended or administered

because it is not stated in patient record

### Definitions

**Bone marrow transplant (BMT): Procedure where bone marrow is used to restore stem cells that were**

destroyed by chemotherapy and/or radiation. Replacing the stem cells allows the patient to undergo higher doses of chemotherapy.

**BMT Allogeneic: Receives bone marrow from a donor. This includes haploidentical (or half-matched)**

transplants.

**BMT Autologous: Uses the patient's own bone marrow. The tumor cells are filtered out and the purified**

blood and stem cells are returned to the patient.

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 222**

-----

**BMT Syngeneic: Bone marrow received from an identical twin. Conditioning: High-dose chemotherapy with or without radiation administered prior to transplant such as**

BMT and stem cells to kill cancer cells. This conditioning also destroys normal bone marrow cells so the normal cells need to be replaced (rescue). The high dose chemotherapy is coded in the Chemotherapy data item and the radiation is coded in the Radiation Treatment Modality--Phase I, II, III data items.

**Hematopoietic growth factors: A group of substances that support hematopoietic (blood cell) colony**

formation. The group includes erythropoietin, interleukin-3, and colony-stimulating factors (CSFs). The growth-stimulating substances are ancillary drugs and not coded.

**Non-myeloablative therapy: Uses immunosuppressive drugs pre- and post-transplant to ablate (destroy) the**

bone marrow. These are not recorded as therapeutic agents.

**Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation (PBSCT): Rescue that uses peripheral blood stem cells to**

replace stem cells after conditioning.

**Rescue: Rescue is the actual BMT or PBSCT done after conditioning. Stem cells: Immature cells found in bone marrow, blood stream, placenta, and umbilical cords. The stem**

cells mature into blood cells.

**Stem cell transplant: Procedure to replenish supply of healthy blood-forming cells. Also known as bone**

marrow transplant, PBSCT, or umbilical cord blood transplant, depending on the source of the stem cells. When stem cells are collected from bone marrow and transplanted into a patient, the procedure is known as a

**bone marrow transplant. If the transplanted stem cells came from the bloodstream, the procedure is called**

a peripheral blood stem cell transplant, sometimes shortened to stem cell transplant.

**Umbilical cord stem cell transplant: Treatment with stem cells harvested from umbilical cord blood.**

## Systemic Treatment/Surgery Sequence

#### Item Length: 1 NAACCR Item #: 1639 NAACCR Name: RX SUMM--Systemic/SurSeq XML NAACCR ID: rxSummSystemicSurSeq

This data item records the sequence of any systemic therapy and surgery given as first course of therapy for those patients who had both systemic therapy and surgery. For the purpose of coding systemic treatment sequence with surgery, 'Surgery' is defined as a Surgery of Primary Site 2023 (codes A100-A900 or B100- B900) or Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery (codes 2-7) or Surgical Procedure of Other Site (codes 1- 5). Systemic therapy is defined as

- Chemotherapy

## Neoadjuvant Therapy

#### Item Length: 1 NAACCR Item #: 1632 NAACCR Name: Neoadjuvant Therapy XML NAACCR ID: neoadjuvantTherapy

*Neoadjuvant Therapy, effective for cases diagnosed 01/01/2021, or later, records whether the patient had* neoadjuvant therapy prior to planned definitive surgical resection of the primary site. This data item provides information related to the quality of care and describes whether a patient had neoadjuvant therapy.

For the purposes of this data item, neoadjuvant therapy is defined as systemic treatment (chemotherapy, endocrine/hormone therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or biological therapy) and/or radiation therapy before intended or performed surgical resection to improve local therapy and long-term outcomes during first course of treatment.

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 0 | No neoadjuvant therapy, no treatment before surgery, surgical resection not part of first course of treatment plan |

Autopsy only 1 Neoadjuvant therapy completed according to treatment plan and guidelines 2 Neoadjuvant therapy started, but not completed OR unknown if completed 3 Limited systemic exposure when the intent was not neoadjuvant; treatment did not meet the

definition of neoadjuvant therapy 9 Unknown if neoadjuvant therapy performed

Death certificate only (DCO)

### Definitions

There are several related but distinct concepts that cover adjuvant therapy, neoadjuvant therapy, and primary therapy. This section contains definitions that can be used in the context of abstracting and coding.

**Adjuvant therapy: Additional cancer treatment given after the primary treatment (usually surgery) to lower**

the risk that the cancer will come back. Adjuvant therapy may include radiation therapy and/or systemic therapy including chemotherapy, endocrine/hormone therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or biological therapy.

**Neoadjuvant therapy: Systemic treatment (chemotherapy, endocrine/hormone therapy, targeted therapy,**

immunotherapy, or biological therapy) and/or radiation therapy given prior to surgical resection to improve outcomes. May also be called pre-surgical treatment or preoperative treatment.

Neoadjuvant therapy may be administered to

- Reduce the disease burden, which might allow surgical resection for previously unresectable

disease or allow for less extensive surgical resection, organ preservation or function, or quality of life

- Eradicate or control undiscovered metastases and improve outcomes of overall survival and

disease-free survival

- Provide prognostic information based on response. A clinical response to neoadjuvant therapy is

associated with length of disease-free survival and overall survival in some cancer types

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 227**

-----

***Note: Limited systemic therapy may be given prior to surgery, or may also occur in clinical trials***

with no expectation of the above-mentioned benefits and should not be coded as neoadjuvant therapy (code 1 or 2) for the purposes of this data item. See instructions for code 3 below. Additional opportunities to use neoadjuvant therapy information

- Allow direct observation of therapeutic efficacy
- Allow time for appropriate genetic testing (if applicable)
- Test novel therapies and predictive biomarkers by providing tumor specimens and blood samples

prior to and during systemic treatment

- Assist in determining the next steps for treatment
- Compare survival, rates of successful optimal reductive surgical resection, postoperative

complications and quality of life

**Limited systemic therapy may be given prior to surgery, or may also occur in clinical trials to study**

biology of cancer or in other circumstances to impact the biology of a cancer but is not a full course of neoadjuvant therapy with the intent to impact extent of surgical resection or other outcomes (organ preservation, function or quality of life).

- Do not code as neoadjuvant therapy (code 1 or 2) for the purposes of this data item. See

instructions for code 3 below.

| Primary therapy: The | centerpiece of | treatment given | for a disease. | It is often part of a | standard | set | of |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| treatments, such as | surgical resection | followed by | chemotherapy | and radiation. It may be | used | alone | to |
| remove or reduce the | burden/progression | of disease | OR used along | with | additional | treatments. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Surgical resection: | For purposes of this | data item, | surgical resection | is defined as | the | most | definitive |
| surgical procedure | that removes some | or all of the | primary tumor | or site. For many sites, | this | would | be |

Surgical Codes 30-80; however, there are some sites where surgical codes less than 30 could be used (for example, code 22 for Breast (excisional biopsy or lumpectomy).

### Coding Guidelines

Use this data item to record whether neoadjuvant therapy was administered. This data item captures a full course of neoadjuvant therapy (generally 4-6 months) or a limited exposure to systemic therapy prior to surgical resection. When part of the treatment plan, a full course of neoadjuvant therapy is recommended; however, there are specific scenarios in which the planned full course of neoadjuvant therapy is not carried out. Site-specific recommendations for neoadjuvant therapy are found in the NCCN guidelines, ASCO guidelines, or other treatment guidelines. For purposes of this data item, the criteria for neoadjuvant therapy are

- A physician's treatment plan and/or statement of patient completing neoadjuvant therapy must be

used

- Treatment must follow the recommended treatment guidelines for the type and duration of

treatment for that primary site and/or histology

The length of a full course of neoadjuvant systemic therapy may vary depending on the primary site and/or histology, often from 4-6 months, but could be shorter, of neoadjuvant systemic therapy and/or radiation

- Neoadjuvant therapy may include systemic therapy alone, radiation alone, or combinations of

radiation and systemic therapy (for example, with rectal cancer, esophageal cancer, head and neck cancer)

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 228**

-----

- Neoadjuvant therapy data items are coded based on treatment/procedures that occur during first

course of therapy

- Neoadjuvant therapy may be given as part of a clinical trial Code neoadjuvant therapy in the corresponding treatment data items even when the treatment is partial (i.e., less than a full course of neoadjuvant therapy is administered) or limited (i.e., limited exposure to systemic therapy)
- *Radiation Sequence and Surgery (if radiation given prior to surgical resection) as part of limited*

neoadjuvant therapy

- *Systemic Treatment/Surgery Sequence (if systemic treatment given prior to surgical resection) as*

part of limited neoadjuvant therapy

- The appropriate treatment data items (Chemotherapy, Immunotherapy, Hormone Therapy,

*Hematologic Transplant and Endocrine Procedures, Radiation Treatment Modality--Phase I, II,* *III), and the associated date data item for each treatment type* Document information regarding neoadjuvant therapy in the text remarks field as needed.

## Neoadjuvant Therapy--Treatment Effect

#### Item Length: 1 NAACCR Item #: 1634 NAACCR Name: Neoadjuvant Therapy-Treatment Effect XML NAACCR ID: neoadjuvantTherapyTreatmentEffect

*Neoadjuvant Therapy--Treatment Effect, effective for cases diagnosed 01/01/2021, or later, records the* pathologist's statement of neoadjuvant treatment effect on the primary tumor or site, with or without lymph nodes and/or distant metastasis, from the surgical pathology report. Whenever treatment effect definitions are recommended by, or available in, the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Cancer Protocols, this data item follows the CAP definitions indicating absent or present effect. When site-specific CAP definitions are not available, use treatment effect codes for All Other Schemas in Appendix C. Site-specific codes are also included in Appendix C of this manual. This data item provides information related to the quality of care and describes the pathological outcomes after neoadjuvant therapy. Prognostically relevant information is captured by quantifying the extent of therapy-induced tumor regression. This item can provide a better risk stratification for patients who received neoadjuvant therapy. In addition, this data item can contribute to assessments of cancer care quality.

### Coding Structure

See Appendix C for site-specific codes coding instructions of Neoadjuvant Therapy--Treatment Effect.

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 0 | Neoadjuvant therapy not given/no known presurgical therapy |
| 1-4 | Site-specific code; type of response |
| 6 | Neoadjuvant therapy completed and surgical resection performed, response not documented or unknown |

Cannot be determined 7 Neoadjuvant therapy completed and planned surgical resection not performed 9 Unknown if neoadjuvant therapy performed

Unknown if planned surgical procedure performed after completion of neoadjuvant therapy Death certificate only (DCO) For purposes of this data item, neoadjuvant therapy is defined as systemic treatment (chemotherapy, endocrine/hormone therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or biological therapy) and/or radiation therapy of the primary site given to shrink a tumor before surgical resection. **Surgical resection:** For purposes of this data item, surgical resection is defined as the most definitive surgical procedure that removes some or all of the primary tumor or site, with or without lymph nodes and/or distant metastasis. For many sites, this would be Surgical Codes 30-80; however, there are some sites where surgical codes less than 30 could be used, for example, code 22 for Breast (excisional biopsy or lumpectomy). ***Note 1:*** Code 0 indicates a patient did not receive any neoadjuvant treatment or received only a short course of hormone therapy that was not part of a clinical trial. If hormone therapy is given as part of a clinical trial, it is coded as neoadjuvant treatment and not coded 0 for treatment effect. ***Note 2:*** Code 6 includes situations where a treatment effect is noted to be present, but cannot be classified to codes 1-4.

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 236**

-----

***Note 3:*** Code 7 includes patients who complete or start neoadjuvant treatment and expire before surgical treatment.

***Note 4:*** This data item is not the same as AJCC's Post Therapy Path (yp) Pathological Response, which is based on the managing/treating physician's evaluation from the surgical pathology report and clinical evaluation after neoadjuvant therapy. This data item only addresses response based on the surgical pathology report.

Assign code 9 when the only information available is the managing/treating physician's evaluation ***Note 5:*** Code 9 includes patients who start treatment and treatment effect information is not available at the time of reporting, such as with rapid case reporting. Revise the code after treatment is completed.

a. There is no information in the patient's medical record about other therapy AND

i. It is known that other therapy is not usually performed for this type and/or stage of

cancer

#### OR

ii. There is no reason to suspect that the patient would have had other therapy

| b. | The treatment plan offered multiple treatment options and the patient selected treatment that did not include other therapy |
|---|---|
| c. | Patient elects to pursue no treatment following the discussion of other therapy. Discussion does not equal a recommendation. Patient's decision not to pursue other therapy is not a refusal of other therapy in this situation. |

(e.g., mycosis fungoides) ***Note:*** Code UVB phototherapy for mycosis fungoides as photodynamic therapy under *Surgery of Primary Site 2023 for skin. Assign code B110 [Photodynamic therapy (PDT)]* when there is no pathology specimen.

| c. | Photophoresis. This treatment is used ONLY for thin melanoma or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides). |
|---|---|
| d. | Cancer treatment that could not be assigned to the previous treatment data items (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or systemic therapy) |

3. Assign code 2 for any experimental or newly developed treatment, such as a clinical trial, that

differs greatly from proven types of cancer therapy ***Note:*** Hyperbaric oxygen has been used to treat cancer in clinical trials, but it is also used to promote tissue healing following head and neck surgeries. Do not code the administration of hyperbaric oxygen to promote healing as an experimental treatment.

4. Assign code 3 when the patient is enrolled in a double blind clinical trial. When the trial is

complete and the code is broken, review and recode the therapy.

5. Assign code 6 for

| a. | Cancer treatment administered by nonmedical personnel Example: Cannabis oil or medical marijuana that is used for treatment. |
|---|---|
| b. | Unconventional methods whether they are the only therapy or are given in combination with conventional therapy Example: DC vax given for brain cancer. Assign code 6. DC vax is not an approved treatment for brain cancer and should not be coded in the immunotherapy or any of the |

other treatment data items. c. **Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) as any medical system, practice, or**

product that is not thought of as "western medicine" or standard medical care. CAM treatments may include dietary supplements, megadose vitamins, herbal preparations, acupuncture, massage therapy, magnet therapy, spiritual healing, and meditation. i. **Alternative medicine is treatment that is used instead of standard medical**

treatments. Alternative therapy is when the patient receives no other type of standard treatment. ii. **Complementary medicine. Treatments that are used along with standard medical**

treatments but are not standard treatments; also called conventional medicine. One example is using acupuncture to help lessen some side effects of cancer treatment in conjunction with standard treatment.

***d.*** **Integrative medicine. A total approach to medical care that combines standard medicine**

with the CAM practices that have shown to be safe and effective. They treat the patient's mind, body, and spirit. ***Note:*** See complete information on types of complementary and alternative medicine specific to cancer at NCI Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine. For additional information on cancer and other diseases, please visit NIH National Center for Complementary [and Integrative Health.](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/)

6. Assign code 8 when other therapy was recommended by the physician but there is no

information that the treatment was given

**September 2023 Section VII: First Course of Therapy 240**

7. Assign code 9 when there is no documentation that other therapy was recommended or

performed a. For death certificate only (DCO) cases

### Coding for Tumor Embolization

The American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), and the SEER Program have collaborated to clarify and refine coding directives for tumor embolization and are jointly issuing the following instructions.

### Definitions

**Chemoembolization: A procedure in which the blood supply to the tumor is blocked surgically or**

mechanically and anticancer drugs are administered directly into the tumor. This permits a higher concentration of drug to be in contact with the tumor for a longer period of time.

**Radioembolization: Tumor embolization combined with injecting small radioactive beads or coils into an**

organ or tumor.

**Tumor embolization: The intentional blockage of an artery or vein to stop the flow of blood through the**

desired vessel.

### Coding Instructions

Code as "Other Therapy" when tumor embolization is performed using alcohol as the embolizing agent. Use code 1.

***Example:*** For head and neck primaries: Ideally, an embolic agent is chosen that will block the very small vessels within the tumor but spare the adjacent normal tissue. Liquid embolic agents, such as ethanol or acrylic, and powdered particulate materials can penetrate into the smallest blood vessels of the tumor. Use code 1 for embolization of a tumor in a site other than the liver when the embolizing agent is unknown. Do not code pre-surgical (pre-operative) embolization of hypervascular tumors with agents such as particles, coils, or alcohol as a treatment. Pre-surgical embolization is typically performed to prevent excess bleeding during the resection of the primary tumor. Examples where pre-surgical embolization is used include meningiomas, hemangioblastomas, paragangliomas, and renal cell metastases in the brain.

at diagnosis, systemic disease, unknown primary, or minimal disease that is not treated. 88 Disease has recurred, but the type of recurrence is unknown 99 It is unknown whether the disease has recurred or if the patient was ever disease-free

### Coding Instructions

1. Assign the code for the type of first recurrence. First recurrence may occur well after

completion of the first course of treatment or after subsequent treatment.

2. Check the Solid Tumor Rules to determine which subsequent tumors should be coded as

recurrences

3. Continue to check for disease-free status, which may occur after subsequent treatment has been

completed, when the patient has never been disease-free (code 70)

4. Continue to check until a recurrence occurs when the patient is disease-free (code 00). First

recurrence may occur well after completion of the first course of treatment.

5. Do not record subsequent recurrences once a recurrence has been recorded (code 04-62 or 88)
6. Assign the highest-numbered applicable response for hierarchical codes 00-70

| a. | Change the code to 00 the first time a patient converts from code 70 (never disease free) to disease-free |
|---|---|
| b. | Assign the proper code for the recurrence the first time a patient converts from code 00 to a recurrence. No further changes (other than corrections) should be made. |

7. Assign code 06, 16, 17, 26, 27, 36, or 46 for recurrence when the tumor was originally

diagnosed as in situ. Do not use those codes for any other tumors.

8. Codes 00, 88, or 99 may apply to any tumor
9. Assign codes 51-59 (organ or organ system of distant recurrence) only when all first

occurrences were in a single category. There may be multiple metastases (or "seeding") within the distant location.

10. Assign code 00 for lymphomas or leukemias that are in remission. The patient is in remission

when the lymphoma or leukemia is controlled by drugs (e.g., Gleevec for chronic myeloid leukemia). a. Assign recurrence code 59 when the patient relapses.

11. Code the recurrent disease for each tumor when there is more than one primary tumor and the

physician is unable to decide which has recurred. If the recurrent primary is identified later, revise the codes appropriately.

12. Assign code 10 for recurrence of a benign brain tumor.

## Underlying Cause of Death

#### Item Length: 4 NAACCR Item #: 1910 NAACCR Name: Cause of Death XML NAACCR ID: causeOfDeath

This is the official underlying cause of death coded from the death certificate using ICD-7, ICDA-8, ICD-9, or ICD-10 codes. This data item is populated by the central registry.

### Special Codes

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 0000 | Patient alive at last contact |
| 7777 | State death certificate or listing not available |
| 7797 | State death certificate or listing available, but underlying cause of death not coded |

### Coding Instructions for ICD-10

1. Ignore (do not record) decimal points when copying codes
2. The cause of death code is commonly four characters. Ignore (do not code) a fifth character if

present.

3. Left justify the codes; if less than four characters, leave the fourth character blank

***Note:*** This is a change from previous instructions.

4. If the underlying cause of death code is not available, do not attempt to code the underlying

cause of death unless you have a trained ICD-10 nosologist on staff or on consult

### Priority Order for use of source documents to assign codes, with 1 having the highest priority.

1. Use the underlying cause of death as coded by a state health department even if the code seems

to be in error

2. Report the coded underlying cause of death code from another source such as NDI Plus or state

data exchange

3. Code the underlying cause of death if a trained ICD-10 nosologist is on staff or under contract
4. Code the underlying cause of death as 7797 when the death certificate is available but the

underlying cause of death code is not coded and cause of death is not available from another source such as NDI Plus or state data exchange

5. Code 7777 when the death certificate is not available AND the coded underlying cause of death

is not available from other sources such as NDI or state data exchange ***Example:*** Medical doctor states patient died, but death certificate not available (not on state death file, not available through federal or state agencies); code 7777. Beginning with deaths in 1999, the United States agreed to code all deaths using the International Statistical *Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). The ICD-10 codes have* up to four characters: a letter followed by 2 or 3 digits.

**September 2023 Section VIII: Follow Up Information 258**

Case data, regardless of the reporting facility, can be released for routine surveillance reporting to NCI, CDC, and NAACCR, for which all reportable tumor records are to be submitted. This item is used in combination with the data item No Patient Contact Flag (NAACCR Item #1854) to identify data that the registry may not be allowed to release.

| Code | Description |
|---|---|
| 00 | No restrictions on release based on reporting facility. This code is assigned if the tumor record is only reported by a facility without potential restrictions on release of data (e.g., in-state hospital, |

physician offices, pathology lab). The code is also assigned if the tumor record is reported by both a facility without restrictions and a facility listed below that potentially has restrictions. For example, if an in-state hospital and a VHA facility report the same tumor, code 00 would be assigned upon consolidation. 01 OOS: Tumor records received only from Out of State (OOS) data exchange with another central

registry 02 VHA: Tumor records received only from Veterans Health Administration (VHA) 03 DoD: Tumor records received only from Department of Defense (DOD) 04 VHA and OOS 05 DoD and OOS 06 DoD and VHA 07 DoD, VHA and OOS

### Coding Instructions

1. Code this data item using the most appropriate code. Blanks are not allowed regardless of

diagnosis year. a. This data item should always have a value for all diagnosis years. If there is no known

restriction, assign code 00.

2. Assign code 00 when codes 01-07 do not apply
3. Record the flag that best describes the reporting facility(ies) that have contributed to the case
4. Update the flag when additional reporting facilities contribute to the case
5. Work with software vendors to populate this data item for information previously captured in

other fields and/or based on the reporting facilities contributing to the case

# Section IX Administrative Codes

Each calendar year the SEER registries submit records to NCI for all persons/reportable neoplasms diagnosed since the registry started reporting to NCI. Many of these records have been updated with information received by the registry since the prior data submission. NCI edits the information to ensure correctness and comparability of reporting. Some of these edits identify conditions that require additional review. To eliminate the need to review the same cases each submission, the Administrative Codes section contains a set of indicators used to show that the information in a record has already been reviewed.
